(a) County Courts
In examining the local administration of justice, we shall have to discuss three items, - County Courts, Magistrates' Courts, and Courts of Mines. We will begin with County Courts, but we shall see ultimately that there is a substantial connection between all three.
County Courts are the modern successors of the old Courts of Requests, established for the decision of small civil cases, principally relating to recovery of debts. We have seen these introduced into New South Wales proper, and their extension to Port Phillip. Soon after separation, they were abolished to make way for the new system, which has been since amplified in many directions.
County Courts are from time to time established and held at places proclaimed by the Governor in Council. Strictly speaking, each court has jurisdiction throughout the whole of Victoria; but if, on the hearing of a common law plaint, it appears that the defendant does not reside, and that the cause of action did not arise within 100 miles of the court, or that the defendant resides at least 10 miles nearer to some other court (the cause of action not arising nearer the court chosen than such other court), the defendant is entitled, as a matter of right, to a non-suit.
Not more than nine barristers or advocates of seven years' practice may be appointed by the Governor in Council to be Judges of County Courts in Victoria. Such judges hold office during good behaviour. The Governor may remove them for absence from Victoria without leave, for incapacity, and upon the Address of both Houses of the Legislature. Each judge presides over such courts as may be assigned to him by the Governor in Council, but his jurisdiction runs throughout the colony. A County Court Judge may not practise at the Bar, nor sit in Parliament, and he may be compelled to reside within his district.
In addition to the judge, there are appointed for each County Court one or more registrars, who may appoint deputies to act for them in cases of emergency, and one or more bailiffs (removable by the judge for inability or misbehaviour), with power to appoint assistants by writing under their hands. The registrar's duties are, briefly, to conduct the administrative business of the court, especially the proceedings prior to the hearing. He issues and receives all process, decides on points of practice, administers oaths, receives fees and other monies, prepares lists of causes for trial, and registers orders and judgments. [157] Assistant registrars may be appointed at places at which no courts are held, to conduct preliminary process. The duties of the bailiff are, briefly, to execute the process of the court, by serving notices and summonses, enforcing warrants, and levying executions. Officers of the court must not be concerned for any party in any proceeding before it, and registrars and bailiffs must not perform one another's duties. Both registrar and bailiff give security for the due performance of their functions. Any registrar, assistant, or deputy proceeded against for any act done in obedience to a warrant issued by him may plead the warrant and the judgment upon which it is founded as a justification; in similar cases, the bailiff or his servants may justify under the warrant alone. And all actions brought against any person for anything done under the County Court Act must be commenced within six calendar months after the commission of the act complained of. All constables and police officers must aid in the execution of County Court process.
Subject to the limits of locality previously mentioned, the jurisdiction of a County Court extends to the following cases - 
1. All personal actions where the amount, value, or damages sought to be recovered do not exceed £500.
2. All actions of replevin where the goods seized do not exceed in value £500. (The action must be brought in the court nearest to which the goods are situate.)
3. All actions of ejectment in which the value of the premises, the possession whereof is sought to be recovered, does not exceed £50 a year, or where the rent (exclusive of ground rent) does not exceed that sum.
4. All suits for account, administration, execution of trusts, foreclosure or redemption of mortgages, specific performance of agreements for sale, purchase, or lease, appointment of guardians to or maintenance or advancement of infants, and dissolution or winding up of partnerships or companies, where the property in question does not exceed in amount or value the sum of £500.
5. All such actions of tort as may be remitted by the Supreme Court upon the affidavit of the defendant that the plaintiff has no visible means of support.
But no County Court may try any action for
1. Seduction,
2. Breach of promise of marriage,
3. Decision of title to a toll, fair, or franchise, unless - 
1. The parties have consented in writing to the jurisdiction, or
2. The case has been remitted by the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court has power, within certain limits, to order a transfer from the County Court to the Supreme Court, in cases where it shall consider the latter the preferable tribunal.

(b) Justices of the Peace; General and Petty Sessions
The specific title of every magistrate in Victoria is "justice of the peace". Many of the justices have other offices, of a more important character, which influence their powers as justices, but, in order that they may act in a magisterial capacity, they are specially invested with the title. It is generally known that the office of "justice of the peace" is very ancient. [158] It goes back beyond question to the fourteenth century, and there are traces of similar offices at a still earlier date. As the powers of the autonomous local authorities disappeared in England, their places were gradually taken by these officials, until the whole character of the local administration was changed. For it has always been a distinguishing feature of the office that it has been created by the Central Government, whereas the older local authorities were created by the localities. Every justice of the peace holds his office from and at the pleasure of the Crown. Another remarkable feature of the office is, that from early times, though not from its commencement, it has been of an honorary character. The overwhelming importance of the justices in local administration dates from the time of the Tudors and the Reformation.
Justices of the Peace in Victoria are of two kinds - 
(a) Specially appointed.
(b) Ex officio.
(a) In every bailiwick such and so many justices as are necessary are "assigned" by commission under the seal of the colony to keep the peace. The commission is in the Queen's name and is signed by the Governor. Justices thus specially appointed have jurisdiction only in their own bailiwicks. At present there are in Victoria between two and three thousand of such justices.
(b) The following persons are ex officio justices of the peace - 
1. Members of the Executive Council,
2. Judges of the Supreme Court,
3. Chairmen of General Sessions, for every bailiwick.
4. Coroners and deputy coroners,
5. Police magistrates,
6. The president of every shire and for every bailiwick the mayor of every borough, in which any part
7. The mayors and mayors elect of their municipality Melbourne and Geelong, is situate, during their terms of office, and twelve months afterwards.

No insolvent is capable of acting as a justice, and the Governor in Council may prohibit any justice from acting.
The duties of justices are now so numerous and important that it will be impossible to give more than a brief outline of them. The simplest way will be to note the different capacities in which a justice may act, and shortly touch upon his duties in each.
Broadly speaking, a justice acts in three capacities - 
(a) As a magistrate out of sessions.
(b) As a magistrate or judge in petty sessions.
(c) As a magistrate or judge in general sessions.
(a) The great function of a justice out of sessions is to receive information of the commission of offences, and to prepare the cases for trial.
Having heard information, either by mere statement or oath, which raises in his mind a reasonable probability of an offence having been committed, he issues a summons calling on the accused to appear and answer the charge, or, if the information has been on oath and an indictable offence is charged, he may issue a warrant ordering his immediate arrest. [159] If the accused does not obey the summons, a warrant may also be issued after sworn proof of service. A justice may compel the attendance of witnesses, and the production of documents.
During the preliminary hearing, the witnesses for the prosecution are examined on oath, they may be cross-examined by the accused or his counsel, and their depositions are taken down by the justice and signed by them. Such examination is not a judicial proceeding, and the justice may, if he thinks fit, exclude the public; but if the evidence, in the opinion of the justice, raises a prima facie case against the accused, the latter must be allowed to call witnesses for the defence, whose depositions are similarly taken. Before hearing the accused's witnesses, however, the justice, if he thinks there is a case, must ask the prisoner if he wishes to make a statement. But the question is accompanied by an elaborate caution as to the effect of such a statement, and the accused is not bound to say anything. If he does so, his statement is treated in the same way as the depositions of the witnesses.
If the justice, after these steps, makes up his mind to commit the prisoner for trial, he forwards the information and depositions to the Crown Solicitor (if the trial is to take place in the Supreme Court) or to the clerk of the peace for the bailiwick (if the trial is to be at general sessions). The witnesses for the prosecution may be, and the material witnesses for the prisoner (except mere witnesses to character) must be, bound by recognisance to appear and give evidence at the trial. If the proceedings require adjournment at any stage, the justice may (subject to certain restrictions) remand the accused to custody, but he may at any stage, even after committal for trial, take bail for his reappearance, except upon a charge of treason. The powers previously enumerated may be exercised by a single justice or by two or more in conjunction. Besides these functions as committing magistrate, a justice of the peace may be called upon to perform an almost countless number of acts of a purely administrative character. .
(b) As a judge or magistrate in Petty Sessions. A Court of Petty Sessions is an open court, constituted by two or more justices, a single police magistrate, or (where the parties consent in writing), a single justice. Courts of Petty Sessions are held at places and times fixed by the Governor in Council. At present there are about 240 of such places in Victoria.
Every Court of Petty Sessions has a clerk attached to it, whose duty it is to keep the register of the proceedings of the court, and conduct its formal business.
Besides the powers conferred on it by special statutes, a Court of Petty Sessions has jurisdiction in the following cases - 
1. Offences made punishable on summary conviction.
2. All cases of assault where the damages claimed do not exceed £50.
3. Claims for the restitution of goods alleged to be illegally detained, where the value of the goods does not exceed £50.
4. Actions for "civil debts recoverable summarily," where the sum claimed does not exceed £50. (Under the head of "civil debts recoverable summarily" are specified a large number of cases which do not, as a rule, involve much dispute as to facts.)
5. Enforcement of fines and penalties recoverable before one or more justices, where no special provision is otherwise made for their enforcement. [160]
But the following cases are expressly excluded from its jurisdiction - 
1. Civil cases in which a County Court has not cognisance for the same cause.
2. Cases involving title to land.
Procedure is by information and summons, and the order of the court may be enforced by warrant of distress or commitment issued by a single justice, or by an attachment of debts, except that a warrant of commitment cannot issue to enforce a "civil debt recoverable summarily." But in all matters involving the payment of a fine of £5 or damages for assault or for trespass by cattle, or involving immediate or contingent imprisonment, an appeal lies from the Court of Petty Sessions to the next practicable Court of General Sessions of the Peace. And, after notice of such appeal, by consent of the parties and an order of a Judge of the Supreme Court, a case may be stated for the opinion of the Supreme Court, the parties agreeing that a judgment in accordance with such opinion shall subsequently be entered at the sessions. A Judge of the Supreme Court may also, on the application of any person injured by a summary conviction or by any order or warrant of a Court of Petty Sessions or a justice, issue an "order to review," calling on the other parties and (if he shall think fit) the justice or justices involved, to show cause why the proceeding should not be reviewed. An appeal lies from the refusal of a single judge to the Full Court, and, in any case, the return of the order takes place before the Full Court, which may confirm, quash, or vary the proceeding complained of. The justices whose decision is questioned may file explanatory affidavits.
(c) As a judge or magistrate in General Sessions. There is a Court of General Sessions of the Peace, which corresponds with Quarter Sessions in England, for every bailiwick, and sessions are held at twenty-eight places provided by statute, at times directed by the Governor in Council. To each Court of General Sessions is attached an official, known as the "Clerk of the Peace," appointed by the Governor in Council, who issues process, arraigns prisoners, records verdicts, judgments, and proceedings, enters appeals, files convictions, and generally conducts the ministerial business of the court.
The only essential member of the Court of General Sessions is the chairman, who is a specially qualified official appointed by the Governor in Council; but any one or more ordinary justices having jurisdiction within the bailiwick in which the court is held, may sit with him. In civil matters, the court may hear all appeals, and take cognisance of all matters cognisable by the appellate jurisdiction of courts of general and quarter sessions in England. In its criminal capacity, it may try all indictable offences within its bailiwick, except about twenty from the more serious classes of crimes. Criminal trials at General Sessions are held before juries of twelve.

(c) Insolvency
The Governor in Council is entitled to appoint "a judge" of the Court of Insolvency, and all Judges of County Courts in Victoria are ex-officio judges of the court, subject however to the local limits of jurisdiction imposed upon them by the assignment of special districts. So that the Court of Insolvency would appear to be a central court with local branches. [161] An appeal from any order of the court lies to the Supreme Court.
Proceedings are commenced by the presentation of a petition to the court, either voluntarily, by the insolvent himself or his representative, or, as a hostile step, by creditors upon the happening of certain events. In the voluntary cases, the court, upon proof of the facts, makes an order vesting the estate of the petitioner in one of the official assignees of the court. In contentious cases, the court makes a provisional order, or order nisi, contingent upon the alleged insolvent not showing cause within a certain time, and, in the interval, the court may place the estate under temporary sequestration. When the order is made absolute, the estate, as in the voluntary cases, vests temporarily in an official of the court, but the creditors are entitled to appoint a trustee and a committee of inspection, and upon confirmation of the appointment by the court, the property passes to the trustee. The insolvent is bound to give up all his property except that which he holds as trustee, and the tools of his trade and necessary apparel and bedding of himself and family to an amount not exceeding £20. The trustee or assignee realises the estate and distributes it amongst the creditors, having for this purpose large disciplinary powers over the insolvent. If the latter complies with the provisions of the law, and has not in the opinion of the court been guilty of causing his own insolvency by fraud or negligence, he may be granted his certificate of discharge, which will free him from all claims provable in his insolvency.
Instead of adopting the process of the court, the creditors may accept a proposal for liquidation by arrangement, in which the estate is realised privately by the creditor's trustee, or they may accept at once a payment of a composition without realising the estate or divesting the insolvent of it.

(d) Courts of Mines
"Within and for" every Mining District there is a Court of Mines, which is held at such times and places as are appointed by the Governor in Council. Judges of County Courts are ex officio judges of all Courts of Mines in Victoria, and, as a matter of fact, Courts of Mines are generally held on the same days and at the same places as County Courts. Owing to the peculiar wording of the legislation on the subject, it is somewhat difficult to pronounce whether Courts of Mines are strictly local courts, but there can be little doubt that a Court of Mines is primarily intended to confine itself to matters arising within its own district. It is, however, expressly provided that a judge of such a court may sit outside its territorial limits.
Besides its judge, each Court of Mines has its clerk, with assistant and deputies, who issue process and keep accounts of the court fees, and generally act under the direction of the judge, and also a bailiff and his deputies, who attend the sittings of the court, and serve and execute its process. Each clerk and bailiff gives security for the performance of his duties, and the functions of clerk and bailiff may not be performed by the same person. Clerks and bailiffs of Courts of Mines are protected against vexatious proceedings in the same way as registrars and bailiffs of County Courts.
Apart from the question of locality, the jurisdiction of a Court of Mines extends generally to all questions and disputes of law or equity arising between miners in relation to mining on Crown Lands, and particularly to questions concerning - [162]
1. Claims by virtue of miners' rights or licences to the user of Crown Land or the user or sale of water thereon.
2. Trespass to or ouster of such claims.
3. Contracts and partnerships for the conduct of mining operations on Crown Lands.
4. Mortgages or charges of mining property.
5. Boundaries of mining property.
Moreover, it has jurisdiction to award compensation to owners of private property whose lands have been claimed for mining purposes.
Within the scope of its jurisdiction, a Court of Mines acts both as a Court of First Instance and as a Court of Appeal from the Warden of the District. But where in an action of debt or contract which could have been brought in the Warden's Court, the plaintiff does not recover more than £100, he cannot recover more than the costs which would have been payable in the Warden's Court, unless the judge of the Court of Mines issues a special certificate. Subject to this limitation, however, a Court of Mines has, when acting within its jurisdiction, all the powers of the Supreme Court in analogous cases, including the power to grant a warrant of possession. But the form of proceedings is similar to that in use in the County Court, except that in all cases either of the parties, as well as the judge, may require the trial of any question of fact by a jury of six assessors.
The decree or order of a Court of Mines is enforced by execution against the property, and any person failing to pay money directed by it may be summoned and examined as to his assets, with liability to imprisonment if he fail to attend. Moreover, the court may grant injunctions, appoint managers of undertakings, and provisional guardians of lunatics against whom it is desired to take proceedings. And bailiffs of Courts of Mines must execute the decisions of Wardens, duly certified to them.
Finally, an appeal lies from the decision of a Court of Mines to the Full Supreme Court, either by way of special case stated by the judge himself, or by way of substantial appeal from his decision. But unless the proceeding is an appeal from an order of the Court of Mines granting a rehearing before itself (which it is competent to make) the appellant must give security for the costs of the appeal. The Full Court may either affirm, reverse, or vary the decision appealed from, or may direct a rehearing before the Supreme Court, and in either case the result is transmitted to the clerk of the court from which the appeal is brought, and is binding on it.
