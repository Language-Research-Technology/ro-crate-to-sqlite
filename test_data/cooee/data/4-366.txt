Mr. B. R. Wise.
Wigram Chambers, Sydney,
November 19th, 1896.
Dear Dr. Machattie, - 
I very much regret that a professional engagement at Newcastle will prevent me attending the Federal Convention; but I shall none the less watch its proceedings with deep interest. You are to be congratulated upon having given fresh vitality to a great movement, and no carping demand for "practical results" can weaken the good effect which your Convention has already produced, by the proof which it affords that it is not the people of Australia who are indifferent about Federation, but the politicians. Any appearance there may be of popular indifference has always seemed to me to be due to a recognition of the fact that the next step forward must be taken by those who are in authority, rather than to any failure to appreciate the magnitude and urgency of the question of national unity. The Bathurst Convention must remove the doubts of the timid, and compel the secret enemies of union to declare themselves. Nothing, I believe, would do more to hasten Union than an open declaration of hostility by those who are opposed to it. Your Convention and its proceedings should force men to take their stand upon one side or the other.
To my mind, there is no other cause worth fighting for in public life, when put beside the cause of Australian unity; not only on account of the obvious material advantages which union must bring with it (these to my mind are among the least important benefits), but because union will enlarge our horizon in all directions, by giving us new standards of criticism in every walk of life. [122]
All that is done in Australia will be upon a different scale and inspired by a higher ideal. Men will write, speak, and work as members of a nation, and not as provincials; and the importance of this fact as a means of elevating civic life no student of history can ignore. Some may consider that these are sentimental considerations, which need not be regarded by "practical men"; but the impetus to all great movements is given by sentiment rather than reason, and no statesman who ignores the sentiment of nationality can be regarded as "practical." The most vivid imagination could not describe the improvement which union will give to Australian modes of life and thought. To effect union should, I venture to think, be the first object of every Australian, and his efforts to effect it ought to be unceasing.
I remain, with hearty good wishes,
Yours very faithfully,
B. R. Wise
The President, Bathurst Federal Convention.
