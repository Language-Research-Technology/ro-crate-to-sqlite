I think she is the most loving tender hearted purest girl I have ever seen or known, that she has a winning loving face that makes you want to love her as soon as seen and, once knowing her, are content to be her slave forever. I think I know no-one can know her and not love her and that she is sure to be a favourite wherever she goes. I think she is a darling and the dearest girl on earth, I think she has two lovely eyes that look more lovingly at me than at anyone else, that her mouth is so sweet and delicious that when I am near it I want a continual feast ever enjoying yet never satieted or satisfied. I think it is one of the most delightful sensations that I can have to have her arms round my neck and her head on my shoulder and wish I could keep them there forever. I think she is like an angel of mercy who takes pity on poor mortals and turns their earth to a paradise, I think the kiss she gave me in the kitchen sitting on the table nearly 3 years ago fixed my destiny. I never got over that. It thrilled through me and when I left Linton and did leave her behind and went to New South Wales that kiss seemed to grow more and more in significance and it assumed immense proportions until the image of Lillie used to be constantly before me [...] to me it seems as if our souls met and refused to be separated again [...] 
I think this will turn out better than I thought. It would be a pity to throw away a good chance. This may be the tide which if taken on the flow will lead to fortune but if missed I may be borne back on the ebb to struggle in vain forever to regain lost ground - hope and be undismayed - I would be quite content if I had you with me my whole soul longs for your society, to have you with me, to be near me - when you are near I have a feeling that I cannot go wrong - goodnight my loved one [...]
