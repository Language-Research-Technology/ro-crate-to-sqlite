It is upon record that the Right Honourable Robert Lowe once said of Mr. Charles Cowper that if he saw the gates of heaven thrown open, he would not walk through straight but wriggle in. As to the vermicular nature of that gentleman's entrance into the abodes of the just, we shall say nothing, because the fact of his ever entering in any style, rectilinear or otherwise, is, without any uncharity on our part, problematical enough. 
But certainly, from the heaven of peaceful private life, he has within the last few days most characteristically managed to wriggle back to the militant earth of politics. Just as Mr. Oakes and Mr. Byrnes had wiped their eyes with cambrics bleached in the orange groves of Parramatta at the thought of their chief - [117]
[...] that chief, like Harlequin, turns up again, and, as usual, by a dodge, is back in the midst of that parliamentary turmoil and strife, where the wicked have not the remotest idea of ceasing from troubling, and where the weary should by all means put the notion out of their heads of ever being at rest. 
Whether the late Prime Minister, making use of his temporary absence from Sydney, visited the tomb of one who he believes was literally sacrificed by the Opposition to the late Government on the Moloch altars of their hatred, and whether at the sight of that holy urn he felt his wrongs incite him to return and take revenge, only Mr. Cowper himself and his more intimate friends know. At all events, it is likely something of the kind will be alleged by the honourable gentleman as the main ground upon which he allowed himself to be brought back into political life. If so, there will be about as much truth, decency, and manliness in the reference to buried affection, as a reason for coming back, as there was in alluding to it as a cause for retiring. When we hinted a doubt last week as to the fact that Mr. Cowper's political obsequies had at length taken place, there was, if not exactly prophetic instinct in the matter, something, at all events, like real knowledge of the true character and habits of the individual under manipulation. We reasoned from the internal nature of things, like philosophers as we are, and the event has pretty fully borne out the prediction and justified the predictor. Mr. Cowper goes back, of course, in opposition. He will take his seat side by side with Mr. Martin and Mr. Darvall, Mr. Parkes and Mr. Hay, and feel it a duty he owes the country to oust as soon as possible from office Mr. Forster and his friends. 
Opposition benches will certainly present as curious an assortment, pure and impure, as Noah's Ark or the Wandering Jew's museum in the American tale. Not only will the lion lie down with the lamb, but the leopard will have changed his spots. 
[118] Mr. Martin will at once discover that an Administration without a Minister who happens to be a lawyer, must of necessity be continually doing things which shake the safety of society to the centre. And Mr. Cowper, whom Mr. Martin so lately, by way of a practical joke, tried to upset in connection with the maladministration of the laws, will see that there are weighty charges in what has fallen from "the honourable and learned member." Of course, Mr. Cowper cannot call him "his honourable friend," he can never descend to that, but he will feel bound to give the motion of the "honourable and learned gentleman" his warmest support. Or Mr. Parkes will revive his warfare on the tea and sugar duties. Mr. Cowper, with the fresh feeling in his mind how spontaneously and with what ardent love and gratitude he has just been re-elected for East Sydney, whatever difficulties might have once been in his own way as a Minister, will ne'er consent to see the poor man's cup, "the beverage that cheers, but not inebriates," taxed in a country where the luxurious positively go free. Or possibly Mr. Darvall may jump up again, on that bête noir of his, the Moreton Bay Separation question. Mr. Cowper, now a free agent, no longer hampered in a manner men in office can alone know or fully understand, will do his devoirs to his constituents and the country at large. 
How far the action taken from that new angle, from which a sense of duty strikes a gentleman who has recently left the position of Premier to take his seat in opposition, may meet the convenience of his successor, it is scarcely necessary to anticipate. Mr. Hay, perhaps, with the modesty of a man who has not practised law in this country, may hint a doubt or hesitate dislike at some judicial appointment hereafter made by Mr. Forster; for there is nothing we know of in that gentleman, his character and talents notwithstanding, removing him from the fallibilities and frailties of humanity. Then think of Mr. Cowper's dignified indignation in addressing the House at seeing a passing shadow thrown, much less a permanent spot fixed, on the purity of the ermine. Perhaps, too, the Tory Attorney-General of Mr. Forster's Cabinet - for if that promising orator, Mr. Richard Driver, Junior, is to be credited, Mr. Forster has already, to this extent, followed in Mr. Cowper's footsteps - may refuse redress against some corrupt and incapable justice of the peace. [119]
A magistrate may have sat on his own case with the view of consummating, by the forms of adjudication, the robbing a poor man of his beast. Hereupon the immaculate Mr. Cowper, who has taken the manufacture and preservation of the commission of the peace under his care, will feel bound that evening, before the question is put, to make a few remarks. If the public only receive timely warning, how the theatres will empty! And if photography could work as effectually by artificial as by solar light, what a moment for Mr. Dalton to take the living sketch, which, embodied in a full length on oils, will preach mildly to coming generations of Australian statesmen the clearness, the charm, and the beauty of honesty as a policy. 
What exact position Mr. Cowper will take in the House it is hard to conceive. The shallowest man has often a surer and better sense of his own difficulties than the most sagacious of his friends. And we believe it was a feeling of this kind which induced the late Prime Minister to retire, for a while at all events, from public life. He had considered, probably more narrowly than those who have recently secured his re-election, the political horizon as it affected himself. A policy on any of the great local questions he had not, and had declared none for that simple reason. 
He was not a waiter on Providence, - there might have been something in that; he was a watcher for stuff to make his measures, of whatever rose to the surface, as to the shifting majorities of the day. Had he had a policy in the real sense of that word, or any fixed and definite views of his own on cardinal public questions, he might have fallen as the greatest statesmen have, grasping his principles in his fall, and with that immortal basis of party which principles, good or bad, few or many, furnish. 
Holding by a living political creed believed in by men, allying them by a common bond, interweaving itself with their interests, a Minister may go down, but he goes down with a strong likelihood of returning. The difference betwixt this, and a Minister who, having lived on credit, and kept himself up by mere personal props, tumbles, or rather falls in, without a scrap of political credit, worn out and found out, is terrible. As there was no inherent political life, so there is no chance of revival or resurrection. For the greater portion of his tenure of office, Mr. Cowper governed by the help of a mere coterie. In bygone times, the affairs of the country were administered by a clique at the Bent Street Club, in our day by a clique at the Victoria Club; formerly by irresponsible officials controlled by aristocratic squatters, latterly by responsible Ministers, with the advice and consent of a number of men, who, in most cases, with very mean pretensions to intelligence, had amassed money and so raised themselves to parliamentary positions. This fact of hole-and-corner government was pretty clearly pointed out and pretty plainly denounced by the Hunter's River constituency at the recent general election. They gave trouble, not because they were specially hostile to Mr. Cowper, but because they felt indignant at being parcelled out in electoral lots betwixt this and that gentleman, members of the Government set, "thick and thin supporters." In a later stage, Mr. Cowper tried to galvanise his effete Ministerial existence by such a use of patronage as to make as many friends in the enemy's camp as his own. When this failed, for even the most extensive patronage must find its limits, he resorted to a device, perhaps more desperate than any Minister on his "last legs" ever dreamed of before; - he took to resignations so contrived as to involve the necessity of his being recalled to office. Practically the honourable gentleman put the matter thus: - "It is quite evident that I am not exactly the right man in the right place, but as I am the best you can get under the circumstances, you must take me, and take me on my own terms." It was a forlorn hope. It was the hope of a shallow schemer at bay; not of one hard hunted, but of one who had taken chase, having little or no wind to run with. The pitcher went too often to the well. A quiet, cynical young man of small experience, Mr. William Forster, disposed of the broken crockery on the disastrous occasion; and the well itself seems likely to turn out a Fountain of Oblivion for the distinguished personage who went to draw at it. Mr. Cowper's reputation as a leader was made in the absence of the dii majores who had controlled our public affairs with an intrepidity and an intelligence which elicited for the shabby little chamber in Macquarie-Street the admiration of enlightened avengers even. Before Mr. Cowper's small candle had caught men's eyes, the lights of Mr. Wentworth and Mr. Lowe had been removed, and Richard Windeyer's had been quenched for ever. Besides, the Minister's political prestige was made in Opposition. There a knowledge of details and of particulars made him effective in the hostile analysis of that mass of minor matters which make up the main business of official administration in a small community. Your man of this stamp is the drop of water on the stone; he kills by inches, but he kills. The man of larger brain sweeps down too often like the thunder shower, and the stone is either bodily swept away or it remains where it was. Mr. Cowper's head, without a high faculty of any kind in it, is, as was once said of somebody else's, a perfect nest of pigeon holes. Facts and figures in all Parliamentary papers and matters of public business are there stowed away, arranged and docketed with exquisite precision and matchless regularity. This has done good service in its way, and the Minister of State who has such an under-secretary may look upon himself as a fortunate man. But it became necessary to work out a free constitution, to construct a land policy, to give the country a sound and expansive apparatus of laws. With the need, came power as a prize of contest amongst men of keen and daring and powerful intellects, heretofore kept outside the gates. Mr. Cowper, with undeniably good abilities of their kind, was not the man. The time for the mere analysis of local appointments and auditing items of estimates had passed; the hour for creation and construction had come. Ex quovis ligno non fit Mercurius. Stringy bark is capital stuff for three rail fences, but useless for building purposes. With no pretensions to ability to deal with great questions, Mr. Cowper, in the older Legislature, and in opposition [122] to Mr. Donaldson and Mr. Parker, won for himself, on the part of the coutitry, something like a feeling of confidence, that if ever he got office, he was pre-eminently the man to exhibit administrative honesty. He obtained this prestige by a sort of reflex operation. As he was one who so well detected faults in others, he must assuredly be one also who possessed none himself, who over and above the honesty it was fair to assume in him, till the contrary was proved, was the person to guard and supervise others. The logic of this was open to objection ; there is a homely proverb about setting certain people to catch other people with weaknesses similar to their own; but it took. [120] [121]
Tried, and found grossly and signally wanting in the common honesties, and even the common decencies, which should surround, as with an impregnable and insurmountable wall, power and place, what is he to do now, when summoning others to judgment ? To fix opponents with corrupt practices was the only faculty and talent of Mr. Cowper's parliamentary life. He will resume his place once more on the Opposition benches, but where will the grace of his vocation be?
