I was not in such great need as you expected but at the same time the order was acceptable as I am now out of work and do not intend doing anything till I am quite rid of my cough. Had I remained another three weeks among Mr. Reid's people I would have been earning something instead of being idle I could, provided my chest was strong, be earning 6s. 6d. a day for very little work on the police. They have only eight hours duty. However I have to content myself with the thought that the summer will make me all right. At present I can eat and sleep well and scarce ever feels ache or pain except on a very wet day or a cloudy day before rain. (I always mention myself first because I know you will want to know how I am first and then you will read or listen to what I have to say, afterwards, better.) I believe that Hugh has had his health as well if not better than when at business at home. Of course he is sometimes troubled with his stomach but you could hardly expect any person who is confined in a draper's shop all day to be as strong as any one who gets the fresh air and plenty of outdoor exercise.
