The HON. T. ELDER, AND W. W. Hughes, ESQ., - As it is scarcely worth troubling you with any detailed account of the proceedings of your exploring party whilst traversing the known country from Adelaide to Alice Springs, near the centre of the continent, I shall give merely an outline of that part of our journey.
We left Adelaide on the 21st September, 1872, reached Beltana Station on the 26th, and started thence for Alice Springs on the 3rd October.
A fortnight was spent in examining the country about the Neales, westward of Mount O'Halloran; but, finding nothing fit for permanent occupation, we struck off for the Alberga river, running it down to its junction with the Stevenson, on which we were detained for a few days by rain and thunderstorms. [138] 
Ascending the Stevenson, which was well watered and fringed with excellent pastoral country, we reached Charlotte Waters on the 25th November, where we were very kindly received by Mr. Johnstone, in charge of the telegraph station.
On the 21st December, 1872, we arrived at the station which was to be our starting-point for our journey westward, namely, Alice Springs. Long. 133° 53' 14' east; lat., 23° 40' south. About 1120 miles distant from Adelaide.
Being assured by those who had resided two years in that part of the country that the summer rains would prevent my moving till the early part of April, I sent Mr. Burt down to Adelaide and Beltana for four months' additional supplies to meet the expenditure of the forced detention. [139] I had much reason to regret this measure; for, instead of long-continued tropical rain, as prognosticated, there was none at all, and I might just as well have started at once.
Mr. Burt, on his return from Adelaide, declined to accompany the party, and my son, as next in seniority, took his place.
The party now consisted of myself, my son (Richard Egerton Warburton), J. W. Lewis, Sahleh and Halleem (two Afghan camel-drivers), Dennis White (cook and assistant camel-man), and "Charley" (a native lad). We had four riding, twelve baggage, and one spare camel, with six months' provisions, and started from Alice Springs on the 15th April, 1873. From this date I shall offer you extracts from my daily journal, which will enable you to follow out our course on the map more readily. 
April 15th, 1873. - As was to be expected, our first day's work was a mere getting under weigh. Two saddles broke, and the loads were unsteady. [140]
Partly owing to the camels being so fat, the saddles would not fit over their humps. This is a fault on the right side. Camped on the telegraph line, about five miles from the springs. Our road over low rocky hills, with mulga scrub (acacia aneura), a gentle ascent all the way. [141]
16th. - The first six miles over similar country to that of yesterday. Took in a supply of water at a creek, then entered a scrubby flat. The scrub is not of that formidable description it had been represented to be, and would have been quite passable, even had there been no road cut through it. [142] The light rain which fell on the 12th, though leaving no surface-water, made parts of the road so boggy that we could not have crossed them had we started a day earlier. One saddle broken again to-day. We camped in the scrub, and have had a treat which few in like circumstances get - rum and fresh milk. I have often abused camels, and persecuted, or rather prosecuted, sly grog-sellers. I will never do so again.
17th. - On the telegraph line. Road still boggy in places. Country good, but especially the last ten or twelve miles to Burt Creek, consisting of fine, open grassy plains. We camped on the Burt. There was a little water in a hole from the late rain, but the government well was quite dry. Have again reason to praise camels and contrabandists. Weather looks like rain, but none has fallen.
15th. - West-south-westerly direction towards the western end of the Mount Hay Range. We had unfortunately neglected to collect the small addition to our water which we might have got; indeed the Burt had been represented such a sure creek for water, that I thought I could turn in to it at any time if I found no water on the more direct course to Mount Hay. The first part of the journey over good open grassy plains, the same as yesterday, but no water. [143] Then the scrub commenced. It became thicker and the grass worse as we went on. Seeing no prospect of water on our direct course, we turned to the north-west, to cut the "well-watered Burt;" but after a few miles the country became still worse, and spinifex took the place of grass. Halted, and though we had but little water, the want did not trouble us, as we fully expected to cut the Hugh river next day.
The Burt is not a creek at all in the proper meaning of the term; it is merely a slight superficial depression on flat ground, carrying off the surface-drainage when the rain is sufficiently heavy and continuous to leave more than the soil can soak up or the shallow pans hold. When there is plenty of water all over the country there is some in the Burt too, no doubt.
19th. - Started on our old course west-southwest for Mount Hay, full of hopes that we must tumble into the Hugh, which had been represented as running through the McDonnell Ranges under Brinkley's Bluff. Travelled all day, but there was no such creek as the Hugh, nor indeed was there any creek at all properly so called, though there were one or two just appreciable depressions over which water would flow when it could not go anywhere else. [144] At six or seven miles' distance from the foot of Mount Hay we emerged from the scrub and entered on the finest grassy plains I have ever seen. There are some shallow water-courses which take off the surplus water and I dare say carry it to feed the Hugh, but that the Hugh as a creek does not exist north of the McDonnell Ranges I am quite satisfied. We camped, or rather threw off the loads, and laid down in the dark after nearly thirteen hours' unbroken riding. We have not seen a drop of water, and have only about one quart, kept for any one who may fall ill for want of it. No fire lighted, as we could not cook without water. Hungry and thirsty, we lay down in silence. I did not speed a pleasant night.
Sunday, 20th - Our first consideration on waking was how to supply our urgent need of water. We could not find any near us, I therefore sent Lewis with the two Afghans and four camels, our empty casks and water-bags, to make their way to "Hamilton Springs," twenty-five miles distant. I knew merely the direction and probable distance of these springs, it was therefore doubtful whether they could be found at all, but, if successful, the party could not return till late at night. [145] We were in great want both of good food and water, but lay down to wait patiently, some of the party suffering much from want of food and water. We had little hope of speedy relief, but, by the goodness of Providence, a blessed shower of rain fell upon us at 1 p.m. All the tarpaulins were quickly spread, and we got two or three buckets of water. What a change ! All was now activity, cheerfulness, and heartfelt thanksgiving. A cake and a pot of tea wore soon in the hands of each, and we were as happy and contented as kings. About 3 p.m. Lewis returned with a full supply of water from clay-pans, without having to go so far as the springs. I hope we may never forget this day.
In the early part of the night rain fell again. We are camped on a low level flat., and have to dig a trench round the fire. All were wet through, but we laid down where we could and slept in peace.
21st. - Spent the day in drying our clothes and baggage.
22nd. - We skirted the north side of the Hay Range, crossed three small gum creeks, all dry; at twelve miles came to a good-sized creek with sandy bed. We followed it down till it turned north-east, and then camped. In ordinary seasons this creek would have given a fair supply of water, and we obtained a little by sinking. [146]
23rd. - Started in a west-south-west direction, varying slightly, now to the southward, and now to the westward. Country lightly scrubbed and beautifully grassed, in parts open glades and good plains; grass in abundance, but no water. Camped under a hill about 200 feet high, from whence we fixed to-morrow's course. Had there been permanent water, a radius of three miles from this hill would have made as pretty a small run as could be desired.
24th - Hitherto the camels have been tied up every night, but this did not allow them sufficient time to feed, so we left them loose. One broke its hobbles and refused to be caught in the morning, which delayed our departure.
I have been hoping for some days to cut the Finke, and am bearing in towards the McDonnell Ranges for this purpose. At two miles we struck a small creek coming from the range. Altered the course a little to clear some hills. Country good. [147] At noon came to a large sandy gum creek, but its course was wrong for the Finke.
This creek is a very fine one, with old, wide-spreading gum-trees, and would in ordinary seasons furnish a good supply of water, but there was none now on the surface. We ascended it for two miles and found a native well. Camped and sunk another, getting plenty of good water. This water must be permanent, as we are travelling in a year of drought. I shall remain here until Monday, the 25th, to rest the camels, arrange our loads, and issue rations. This is the first water of a permanent character we have met with for nine days.
I went with Richard up to the head of the creek, which runs in a narrow gorge; we found no water, but many marks of there being plenty in usual seasons.
25th and 26th. - I have taken every means of fixing our position as accurately as possible, because this place Will become a fresh starting-point; the latitude is 23° 25' 27'; the longitude, by account, 132° 34'0''; and the variation of the compass, 2° 30' 0' east.
Sunday, 27th. - Resting in part. Rations issued for a week. Map and journal brought up. Water bags filled. [148] Dampers baked and meat boiled. Camels brought in and saddled. Everything ready for an early start to-morrow.
A pleasant ride through a well-grassed country. Camped at 4 p.m. on a fine gum creek - -the Dashwood. No surface water.
29th - Several camels strayed, so we could not start until 1 p.m. At a short distance up the creek we found a native well in the sand, and filled all our bags. After travelling a couple of miles south-west by south, we turned south to examine a cascade 280 feet high, with some nice pools of water in the rocky ledges. Struck the creek again and camped on it, but it contained no surface-water.
The country to-day has been beautiful, With park-like scenery and splendid grass. Water procurable at easy depth in the creek. Strong south-easterly wind all night.
30th. - Thermometer down to 41° Fahrenheit this morning. Travelled up to head of the creek, finding a good pool of water in a rocky glen. As the present has been a year of drought, I think this water must be permanent. Both banks of the Dashwood abound in springs, and water might be got anywhere in ten minutes. [149]
Leaving the glen, had to return nearly to our camp before we could head westward. Turned south in the afternoon, to try whether the Finke really did run through the McDonnell Ranges, as confidently stated by some. We camped at 4. p.m. under a granite hillock. Country not so good.
May 1st. - Following a south-westerly course, we found a shallow clay-pan and watered the camels. We came upon a large creek, but running the wrong way for the Finke; two hours afterwards struck another creek, also running in the wrong direction. This is our last hope, and it is now quite certain that the Finke does not run through the McDonnell Ranges but takes its rise in the midst of them.
It was necessary to settle this question, as my future course depended upon it. Had the Finke come from anywhere north of the McDonnell Ranges, I should have steadily run it up. We shall trouble ourselves now no more about this fable. Obtained a midday observation and started afresh to the northward and westward. At 2 p.m. struck a small, poor-looking creek, but it had a pool of surface water, so we camped here, congratulating ourselves upon our first camp near surface water. [150] The camels drank with apparent satisfaction, but when it came to our turn the water was so intensely bitter we could not use it. This water was beautifully clear, and had every appearance of being perfectly drinkable. Its bitterness was most intense, though none of the party were able to ascertain from whence this arose. This creek crosses the Tropic of Capricorn.
2nd. - Rounded what we supposed to be Haast's Bluff, of Giles, and at 9 a.m. struck a fine sandy creek, fringed with gum-trees, but with a clear level bed. At a distance of four or five miles down the creek we found water and shot two black cockatoos (probably either Calyptorhynchus funereus, or C. Baudini, Gould). We continued down the water-course and camped on its left bank. This is certainly a beautiful creek to look at. It must at times carry down an immense body of water, but there is none now on its surface, nor did its bed show spots favourable for retaining pools when the floods subsided.
3rd. - We still continued down the creek, hoping to find a lake at its mouth. It continued for ten or twelve miles farther - a magnificent watercourse - but after that it fell off. As it reaches the lower level, its banks cannot confine the floods which inundate the flats; the channel narrows, trees take root, and sand-banks intercept the stream, which finally splits into narrow water-courses and spreads itself over the plains, and so it ends as a creek. [151]
Camped at the end of the creek. No water.
4th. - Sent two of the party with spades up the creek to look for water, and followed myself shortly afterwards with the rest. Water was found in a clay hole on the right bank, and we halted for Sunday.
5th. - Started north-west by west over sandy scrub. At eight miles the country became more open, with spinifex and casuarina-trees. Crossed low sand ridges running east and west.
Nothing but spinifex, mulga scrub, and casuarina forest all day, the latter giving a melancholy beauty to the scenery, more resembling a Turkish cemetery than anything else. The trees are straight-stemmed and tall. I should think they would be well suited for telegraph poles, if it were possible to cart them away. They stand in thousands and thousands, but there is not a scrap of feed nor a drop of water in the country.
6th. - The camels went off in the night; no great wonder, as they had nothing else to do. [152]
Starting at noon, we travelled eleven miles over the same sort of country as yesterday, and reached the western end of Central Mount Wedge. We could not find any water, and things were not looking well. Camped in the afternoon under the mount and on the edge of our first salt - lake. In the night wild dogs were heard, and water-birds flew over us - both good signs.
7th. - Thinking it possible we might have to return to Sunday's camp, I halted for the double purpose of resting the camels and searching for water. I sent out in three different directions, and one of the party returned quickly, having found a rock-hole with a soakage spring near the camp.
Thus relieved from anxiety, I proceeded to measure Central Mount Wedge. It is a very remarkable hill in the Mount Wedge Range. When I first saw it from a moderate elevation, at a distance of seventy or eighty miles, no other part of the range was visible, and it stood out as an isolated hill from a sea of scrub, bearing a striking resemblance to Mount Wedge Island (a small island situated near the coast of Western Australia), as seen from a distance at sea.
Measuring with all the care I could, its total height from the high saddle on which it stood proved to be 1650 feet; the eastern point being a perpendicular scarp of red rock, 615 feet above the slope of the mountain; it was this sharp-cut face that I had seen from a distance. [153]
The hill was too formidable for me to ascend. Two of the party, however, went up for me, as I wanted the bearing of some hills to check my longitude; it was a very arduous task, and on reaching the summit a thick haze prevented anything being seen distinctly. The barometer also was of little use, as it fell below its marked scale. In descending, one of the men had a narrow escape from a large piece of rock which grazed him as it fell.
One of the water-searchers returned in the evening, having found some splendid waters in glens in the range. The Afghans, who had also gone out in the morning, returned; they had found no water, but, what was much worse, had contrived to lose a camel, or rather to let it run away With saddle and all equipments. This camel was a serious loss. It seems, from the account given by its rider, that he dismounted to pick up some object which attracted his attention, and tied the animal up, but that it broke his nose-rope, and immediately made off. [154]
5th. - I sent off the Afghan on my riding camel to recover the runaway animal, and moved the camp in the afternoon seven miles along the range opposite the glens found yesterday, promising to remain there till he returned. He joined us again in the evening, but without the camel; he stated that he had ridden sixty miles and lost the tracks. This accident never ought to have happened at the hands of a professed camel-driver; the loss was very heavy, the animal being one of our best riding camels.
9th. - Saddled the camels and took them as far up the first glen as they would go; but they were so frightened at the stupendous rocks that they could not be got to the water; we therefore sent them round to the second glen, which is more easy of access, but the same thing occurred there, the perpendicular walls of rock which towered above them excited such terror that they would not taste the water even when brought to them in a bucket. This was unfortunate, as we particularly wished them to lay in a good supply, to carry us through the dry country we are now in.
We went to explore the glens. I might, perhaps, by degrees, convey to another person in conversation some idea of these places, but I cannot attempt it in writing; they are very grand and imposing. [155] At the entrance of the first glen a huge column of basalt has been launched from a height of about 300 feet, and has stuck perpendicularly in the ground; the base has been worn away by the torrent, and cannot much longer support this heavy top. It stands a sentry to guard the beautiful pool, which occupies the whole width of the entrance to the glen. I had no time for accurate measurements, and give only estimates. The pool is about fifteen feet wide, fifty long, and the basaltic walls which enclose it are about 300 feet in perpendicular height. Looking from the entrance, the view does not extend beyond thirty yards, but after scrambling that far, another turn in the glen at a right angle to the first, shows a still grander split in the mountain, with a large circular pool of deep clear water, almost wholly roofed over by a single huge slab of basalt. As the sun cannot reach this water, it never can fail.
The second glen is on the whole less rugged and grand, but more picturesque. We ascended to the head of this glen, finding many springs and much running water. It is impossible to do these grand places justice by any verbal description; they must be seen to be rightly appreciated. [156] I have called the first "Glen Elder," the second "Glen Hughes," after the public-spirited projectors under whose auspices this expedition has been sent out.
I could have spent a week at this interesting place pleasantly, and in the afternoon left it with regret. We travelled over eleven miles of alternate porcupine-grass (triodia pungens, or spinifex) and scrub, towards a low hill to the north-west. No signs of water; but we seemed to have passed out of the region of the salt lagoons.
10th. - North by west over this wretched country, no water-courses, no grass, nothing but porcupine-grass and scrub. Advanced seventeen miles towards what I suppose to be a part of the Reynold's Range, our latitude being 22° 25' 5'. [157]
Sunday, 11th. - Obliged to move, to try for water for the camels. Sent two of the party on ahead in different directions to look for it. They each found a little, and we camped on a rock-hole that in ordinary seasons would have supplied all our wants.
12th. - Pursued a westerly course along a well-grassed valley, between two ranges. Halted at the end of the valley, to await the return of two water-seekers in the ranges. Some water had been found in the upper part of a sandy creek. I went to see it, and then settled to send the camels at daylight next morning, bare-backed, to feed and drink all day.
I was much vexed at my carelessness in not knowing there was to be a total eclipse of the moon. I might have been prepared to some extent by rating my Adelaide timekeeper, and getting my true time at camp, and though I had no telescope that would note the different contacts and phases accurately, I might have approximately corrected my longitude. [158] Taken by surprise, when the eclipse commenced, I could get nothing to be safely relied upon, though I tried. It was a splendid sight, and our view was perfect. The moon was at its full, and the eclipse commenced shortly after sundown, lasting for about two hours, during half of which time it was total. After an hour the shadow began to move off.
15th. - Halt. Recruiting camels and filling water-bags.
14th. - Travelled twenty miles towards a granite range, over good country, grassy scrub, with patches of salt and cotton-bush. For the last six miles the plain was dotted over with large granite mounds, and intersected by several creeks running northward.
In the evening two of us scrambled up some steep, bare, smooth sheets of granite, which formed the southern face of part of the range. [159] I did not like the task, being obliged to take off my boots and clamber up on hands and knees. We found a fine hole in the face of the rock, perfectly round and nearly full of water. This hole was entirely a work of nature, and, strange to say, was on the point of a smooth projecting part of, the rock, where it might have been supposed impossible for any water to lodge. How it could have been formed in such a place I cannot conceive, but so prominent was its position as to be visible from the plain at a considerable distance. The descent was, to me, nearly as bad as the ascent; a sitting slide, feet and fingers acting as skids. The portion of the rock in which this hole was situated presented a convex form, and was more than 100 feet above the level of the plain.
One camel useless from sore back. This never ought to have happened, but the fault cannot now be remedied, so it need not be laid upon any particular shoulders.
15th. - Proceeding on a westerly course over a scrubby plain, between two ridges, we struck a fine creek, and camped of course upon it. There was no surface water, but we found fine springs about a mile or two up the creek. [160] 
16th. - Sent camels and water-bags up to Annie's Springs. We started in the afternoon, and made ten miles of good westing; passed a likely-looking place for water, but, not being in immediate want of it, I did not stop to examine it.
We did eighteen miles to-day, but not on one course; the final result, however, was nearly west, there being only a few seconds' difference between our latitudes of to-day and yesterday.
Our camp is on very high ground at the foot of granite rocks in the range; the spot is very pretty, and the hill under which we are located has two immense boulders of red granite at the top. This is a marked hill, and, though of no great altitude above us, is still very high and can be seen from a great distance.
Lewis, though far from well, discovered a fine water-hole in a gap in the range, and as we have also found water near the camp, we are all thankful and happy at the prospect of a fine Sunday.
Sunday, 15th. - Halt. Weekly rations issued; true time at camp taken, variation of compass, 10 16' east; lat., 22° 11' 48" south; long., by account, 130° 40' east.
19th. - Proceeding north a short way, to round the hills, then turned west ten miles. Struck a small creek, which we went up six miles, but found only a little water, not enough for our wants. [161] Camped in thick scrub; our general course upon the creek was south-east, but we made little headway; Sunday's camp bearing north, 63° east, about seven miles.
20th. - We are now amongst a jumble of low granite hills surrounded with thick scrub. No leading water-course, and the country due north and west looks bad; little hope of water. Sent the empty bags to the mall drainage-hole down the creek to be filled, and ascended a neighbouring hill, to see what course would , be the best. Two out of the three sides open to us looked very dismal; therefore altered the course S.S.E. for a promising-looking break in the range we had been leaving behind us. This is a great disappointment, and it keeps us hanging about the same locality, but there is no help for it.
Went six miles through thick scrub and camped at the foot of the range. My two assistants looking for water, found likely places, but they were all dry.
21st. - Kept the camp standing to save the camels, and again sent out my two companions to examine the range ahead. They found a splendid water-hole in a gorge about six miles off, so our minds are now relieved from the fear of having to make back-tracks. [162]
22nd. - Five miles south-west along the foot of the range brought us to the water found yesterday. This is a fine place, and the source of a long creek; the whole ground over which the waters first emerge from the hills may be called one spring, as water is procurable anywhere on the flat. The centre water-course was running, though there could not have been any rain for a long time. It is the best place we have yet seen for a camp; running water, bulrushes, and gum-trees, with good feed for the camels, are not found every day in the centre of Australia in a year of drought.
The name "Eva Springs," with our camp brand W., and the year, are carved on a tree. This gorge has two branches, in both of which there is water; but that in the right-hand one, though more abundant, is not accessible to animals. It could never, however, be wanted, as the springs would give an inexhaustible supply. Some parts of the water are covered with a greasy slime, from what cause I know not; the water itself is quite pure and good, the oily scum not mixing with it. This greasy covering was iridescent, but perfectly tasteless. [163]
The place being so favourable, I left the camp standing, under Lewis's charge, with directions to do his best to mend the camels' backs and their saddles, to re-arrange their loads, and throw away everything we could safely dispense with, whilst my son and I went out for a week, to try what the country ahead could produce.
23rd. - I started with Richard and Charley (the black boy), south-west along the range, over villainous country. Something in the scrub frightened the leading camel, it turned suddenly round, and ran off as fast as it could; of course the other two followed its example, and shared its fright, though they could not have seen what caused it. Three men rushing wildly through the bush on runaway camels, which they dared not try to pull up for fear of breaking the nose-ropes, must have been a ludicrous sight, and when we collected our scattered forces and recovered our dropped articles, we all had a hearty laugh at each other. [164]
Luckily camels are not much given to running away, otherwise it would prove, a serious matter. If the rider pulls at the single string that forms the means of guiding the animals, the only result is that its head is brought round to the fore part of the saddle, without in the least diminishing its headlong career; and as the camel can form no idea of where he is going, either a heavy fall or the laceration of the cartilage would be the most probable effect of an attempt to pull up. Though these animals prefer travelling in single file, they scatter wildly in every direction when terrified. On this occasion each of the three camels took a different course, and the ludicrous effect was much heightened by the peculiar position of the riders on the hind seat of the saddles.
Passing through an opening in the range, we reached a better travelling country, and camped in the afternoon on a high plain with more scrub. South by west were three remarkable hills, distant about twenty-five miles, one table-topped, quite flat and scarped all round, the middle one saddle-backed, and the third wedge-shaped and scarped at the point. [165] All three seemed very high, and high also were our hopes of finding something good about them. A few drops of rain fell in the evening.
24th. - Started for the hills over good travelling country, lightly scrubbed. At twelve miles struck a large gum-creek, bordered by exuberant vegetation, and forming a very fine piece of country. We crossed the creek, expecting to find water amongst the gum-trees ahead, but found none. Coming upon some good patches of cotton-bush, we camped, thinking to do the camels a kindness, but they would not remain on them because we had put them there.
It was a most uncomfortable place for us; the ants swarmed over everything, and over us; indeed they wanted to take away the cockatoos we had for dinner, but we rescued them. We had a little drop of rum, and did not forget to drink the health of "the Queen," this being her Majesty's birthday. Finding the camels would not stay where we wanted, there was no inducement for us to remain, so we saddled up and went back to the creek, where we had at least clean sand and no ants.
Sunday, 25th. - We were obliged to move, not having found any water since leaving our depot. We examined the mouth of the creek, which expended itself by inundating a large tract of level country, the vegetation exuberant but dry, with dry beds of back-water lagoons. [166] Were it not a year of absolute drought, we should here have found plenty of water.
At 9. a.m. started for Table Mountain, but on getting near it could see nothing that indicated a lodgment of water, nor any water-course; so as we were nearly at the end of our own supply, we could not afford to run the risk of losing the whole of next day in what might turn out a fruitless search. Under the circumstances, it was better to shorten our distance from the depot rather than to increase it, we therefore turned so as to cut our creek higher up than we had at first struck it, and then run it up.
Camped in the creek again near a native well, in which at first a few drops of water were visible; but it was only the drainage of a light shower on Saturday, and disappeared on the removal of a little sand from the bottom.
26th. - Rode ten miles up the creek without seeing any place that promised water. At last our eyes were gladdened by a comparative verdure at a spot on the right bank. Here we found a native well, and, clearing it out, came upon a splendid spring of excellent water. [167] Thus relieved, we were at liberty to extend our trip, instead of returning crestfallen to the depôt.
27th. - West by north, eight miles. Scrub all the way. Examined some low granite hills, found a drainage-hole, dry, also native tracts, some sticks burning at a camp, and a chopped tree, but no water.
We travelled ten miles farther through scrub between low hills, until, reaching a dead flat expanse of sandy scrub, I deemed it hopeless to look for water in such a locality. We camped in the scrub, tormented with flies, worked hard to cut out a native bees' hive, but got no honey, their house was empty.
The weather all day was cloudy and very hot, unlike a tropical May day. At night we were blessed with a heavy thunder-storm and drenching rain. [168]
25th. - It rained all night, and we spent the whole morning drying our clothes. In the afternoon we started eastward on our return to the depot. After eleven miles, partly through bad scrub, we camped under the lee of a low granite hill; it rained again heavily during the night, but, being now on a slope, we were not obliged, as we had been the night before, to dig trenches round our blankets to prevent being flooded out. The rain is a blessing; personal discomfort, therefore, is of no consequence.
29th. - Returned to the depot through a good deal of scrub, but there was abundance of water all about, and the creek which we had left so dry two days before was now running.
30th. - Hoping to push through the bad country before us on the rain that had fallen, I broke up the camp and started west. Bad scrub part of the way; camped near a small creek we had passed on our return yesterday. There was every appearance of rain in the evening, but it turned off into heavy dew.
31st. - Foggy. Travelled west. Found a creek running east and west, which we had not seen before when up here. There was no surface water, although the heavy rain was so recent. [169]
Turned south and camped on some clay-pans.
Sunday, June 1st. - Rest and water.
2nd. - Travelled west thirteen miles, through scrub all day, more or less thick. We found a small clay hole just sufficient for a night's supply, and camped.
3rd. - Sixteen miles over high sandy table-land, moderately scrubby. There was no hope of water in such a country; no water-course was met with all day, and no hills seen to the westward. Bad place for camels, but no better to be found.
4th. - Continuing west, we saw some crested doves, and spent an hour looking all round for water, but found none. [170] After travelling twenty miles, camped under a sand ridge.
The sand ridges here have gum-trees of an inferior description growing on the top of them; I never saw this before, and hoped to obtain water by sinking, but all our efforts were useless. [171]
There being so slight a prospect of water ahead, I did not like to take the party farther away from the clay pans on which we had camped on the 81st. [172]
5th. - Left the camp standing. Took Lewis and started west, for four miles through level scrub country between sand ridges; five more through a burnt, bare casuarina forest. Two miles farther a slight but extensive depression under a sand ridge. Here the vegetation was exuberant, tea-tree (Leptospermum or Melaleuca), spinifex, and scrub; searched all over it diligently for water, but found none; in fact, surface water cannot lodge on this country much longer than ten minutes, it must sink through the sand. This was a place which evidently received such excess of water as the surrounding country could not at once absorb, but it held none within our reach. We continued our journey; country slightly changing, and apparently improving. Camped, after doing forty miles, under a low stony hill. We were now some few miles within Western Australia; being the first, I think, who had entered that province from South Australia, excepting just on the coast line. I greatly wished to go on next day, but our camels were not over-fresh, and it would have entailed an extra two days' halt on the main party, and have made it ten days before we could reach our nearest known water. [173]
6th. - Ascended again the hill under which we had camped. The setting sun of the previous day had painted the prospect ahead in fairer colours than the reality of the rising sun confirmed, and I had less reason to regret my inability to go forward. The Table Mountain which I had visited on the 25th ult., was visible at eighty or ninety miles' distance.
Reached the camp at 7 p.m. The only result of our eighty-mile ride being a conviction that for the present, at least, we must return to the clay pans of the 31st ult., and, if dried up, then back to the depot creek.
7th. - The morning broke with an appearance of rain, but it will do us little good beyond what we can collect in a tarpaulin. As usual, when most wanted, ten camels had strayed back on the track and delayed our start.
Rain came on in the afternoon when we were on better holding-ground, and enabled us to water the camels. On to camp at eighteen miles.
Sunday, 5th. - Continued on our back-tracks. All the surface water of the previous afternoon was dried up, and there was a cold south-easterly wind all day. [174] Ascended a hill a few miles off the track, to examine what appeared a distant range to the northward, running east and west. We thought very favourably of it, and hoped to make west again into West Australia by its aid. Camped at the place where we had been on the 2nd.
9th. - Started for the range seen yesterday; found some clay pans, and watered the camels. Sunk some holes for the water to drain into, should we again have to come back.
After travelling fourteen miles, we unexpectedly struck a short creek running east and west; it had plenty of water from the late rain, this will give us a depot, should the range prove unprofitable.
10th. - Proceeded down the creek; it had a good holding bottom of indurated clay and sand, with plenty of water, and many native wells. But it ran out in a couple of miles, and lost itself in a flat. We continued towards the range, which we reached in the evening, and found to be worthless, consisting only of low broken hills standing on very high ground. There was no sign of water, except the sight of two wild dogs. [175]
11th. - Returned to camp of the 9th, examining the country right and left for water, without success.
12th. - Halted to-day, in order to rest the camels and prepare for an eight days' trip to the northward.
12th. - I started with my son and Charley towards a prominent bluff in the range, seventeen miles distant; the ground as we approached appeared to improve in its firmness, but the rain had run off it into a flat that would not hold. We looked in vain for water, and, ascending the bluff about 350 feet high, the prospect all round (except where we had come from) was far from exhilarating; a flat, sandy, scrubby country, lightly dotted here and there with clumps of casuarina, and covered with the never-failing spinifex, was all that could be seen. There were, however, natives in the neighbourhood, but we cannot get near them, and they won't come to us. They must have water somewhere, but we can find no trace of it.
14th. - North course twenty-four miles; camped under a sand ridge. On our way we surprised three blacks, who fled from their camp at our approach. They left their fire burning, and their weapons behind them. [176] We took a Boomerang for Oharley, and left a piece of blanket in exchange.
15th. - Travelled twenty-eight miles through thick spinifex, a most hopeless country indeed.
16th. - Travelled thirteen miles north; the spinifex thicker than ever, and covering the whole country as far as could be seen. Found a few small Leichhardt trees for the first time. It being useless to fatigue the camels by taking them any farther through this interminable spinifex, we camped, and decided to retrace our steps next day. We had travelled eighty miles due north, and the country was getting worse and worse.
17th. - Returning.
15th. - Returning. Caught sight of a Lubra (a native woman) with a small boy and an infant. My companions gave chase, but their camels did not like leaving the track, and would not step out; they bellowed lustily, which made the woman run faster; she tossed away everything but the baby, and escaped. Oharley, however, captured the lad, who showed not the slightest fear, but looked at us and our camels as if quite accustomed to the sight. We put him on the camel, in front of Oharley, and made signs for him to show us where we could find water. Even this unusual exaltation and mode of progression did not seem to frighten the urchin, who kept chattering and pointing to the west. [177] We turned in that direction, but before we had got far Charley's sharp eyes detected some diamond-sparrows rising from the ground, and he immediately ran off to look for water. [178]
He found a native well with some water, and we soon saw another close by. [179] This discovery caused us immense joy, for we saw the water draining in as fast as we drew it out, and we thought we had now got the key of the country and would be able to get water by sinking in any suitable flat. The lad only indirectly benefited us, as he was going past the wells, but we here offered him some food, and let him go; he refused to eat, and sneaked away, thinking, no doubt, how cleverly he had eluded us, when he got out of sight. Watered the camels and filled our bags, then went on our way rejoicing that our long ride had not been useless. These we named the "Waterloo Wells." [180]
19th. - Returning to main camp.
20th. - We made a detour round the bluff range to look on all sides of it for water, but found none. Reached our depot on "Ether Creek" in the afternoon.
21st and 22nd. - Spent these days resting our three camels and preparing to start for the wells. Lewis had been up the creek, which he found spread out into flats and got lost, then picked itself up again, and became a creek once more. This being the case up the creek, I thought probable it might be the same down it, but on examination this proved not to be so; it was finally lost in the flat to which we had before traced it.
23rd, 24th, and 25th. - Returned with the whole party to Waterloo Wells. We enlarged, cleared, and deepened them, getting an abundant supply of delicious water. [181] Sahleh, one of the camel-men, was now very ill with scurvy; the other one is also lame and ailing, but not so bad. Towards evening Sahleh made his will, which he dictated to me in Hindustanee.
26th. - Sahleh is no worse to-day, but he won't allow that he is any better. The two wells which we cleared and enlarged yesterday have an abundant supply of water; they have sufficient for a depot, should we be driven back again in our endeavours to cross this high table-land; but I hope we shall not be compelled to use them.
We started at 10 a.m. towards the west. After five miles' march we turned north-west, across a sand ridge; the country becoming slightly undulating with low hills visible to the north-west. Camped at 4 p.m., after travelling eighteen miles, between two widely separated sand ridges. Spinifex, scrub, and sands as usual.
27th. - I sent the camels on, and went with one companion to the top of a small ironstone hill; the view was anything but cheerful. Found two stone slabs marked, and a round stone hidden in a hole on the top of the hill; brought them away as curiosities. [182] Heard a wild dog in the night, but found no water.
25th. - Cloudy; a few drops of rain fell. - Travelled seventeen miles in a north-westerly course. [183] The country to-day has been improving, if tea-tree plats be an indication of water. At 3 p.m. we crossed a stony ridge, and camped in a tea-tree plat, where we expected to find as much water as we wanted; but on sinking we were soon undeceived - there was none.
Sunday, 29th. - Cloudy. We deepened last night's well, but with no better result than yesterday. Started in a north-westerly direction and sunk another hole near a sand-ridge, but found no water. Went on a little way, then turned southwest, as the country ahead gave no hope of water. We then camped, and dug three more wells in different places, all with the same unsuccessful result. We did not make more than five miles to-day, as it was unadvisable to increase our distance from the last known water, already fifty miles away; but we hoped, by digging on the return journey, not to be obliged to go so far back as the Waterloo Wells.
30th. - Whilst at the wells the camels were not thirsty, and would not drink when water was offered to them, so they have had none since leaving "Ethel Creek." Now that there is none for them they want it, and as the feed is both scanty and dry, they wander, and when we particularly wish to make an early start on their account, they are absent without leave. [184] We started at 11 a.m., on our return - a great disappointment! Dug three more useless wells on the way, and camped at 5 p.m.
July 1st. - Camels again absent. Started at 9 a.m.; more digging to-day, and no water.
2nd. - Dug two wells on the way - both dry. But we found two native wells at about two miles west of the Waterloo Wells; they had, however, very little water, and would have required many hours' labour to fit them for our service, so we went on. One of our wells was found in good order, half of the other had fallen in. We fished out the drowned rats and watered all the camels before sunset. [185]
3rd. - Sahleh is so very ill that I must remain here several days to give him a chance of his life.
4th, 5th, and 6th. - Sahleh has been nearly dead; he has lost the use both of his legs and arms; cannot move; can scarcely speak, and cannot take any food but rice-water. He is utterly powerless, and unable to travel unless I strap him on to a camel like a bag of flour, and this would probably kill him; so I shall remain here, and send out a reconnoitring party to-morrow.
7th. - I sent Lewis and Dennis with three camels, a good supply of water, and ten days' provisions. Lewis' instructions are to hunt and dig for water in any likely-looking places, in any direction except one with casting in it.
I think Sahleh looks a little better to-day.
5th. - Sahleh looks worse; he is in a critical state, and must either mend or die. We have nothing but citric acid to give him; he cannot eat.
9th and 10th. - Sahleh is certainly better; we have discovered a small yellow berry in the scrub, which, after proving it not to be poisonous, we have made him eat.
11th and 12th. - Ice a quarter of an inch thick in the buckets in the morning. [186]
13th. - Induced a black to come to our camp, but he trembled with fright, particularly when he saw the camels.
14th, 15th, and 16th. - Sahleh fast recovering. Lewis ought to be back to-day.
19th. - Lewis is not yet returned, and I am getting anxious about him. Six natives came to the camp, but we could not understand each other. We watched these scamps with the utmost care and closeness, as we thought, but they were too much for us, and stole an axe; this of course put an end to their visits. These blacks had been seen prowling about in the neighbourhood of the camp, and, by means of shouting and beckoning, were induced to visit it. They were fine, well-made men, most of them bearded, and, considering the wretched hand-to-mouth life they lead, were in very fair bodily condition. Clothing they possessed none; they were armed with spears and waddies, or short clubs, the latter of which they use to knock over the wallabies, a small species of kangaroo, on which they seem mainly to subsist.
After sunset Lewis returned, to our great relief. He brings good news, having found a place 100 miles distant, where water is procurable by digging. [187]
This is all we want, and gives us another secure step in our journey. He went forty miles farther westward, and came upon a dry salt lake; I shall be careful to round this to the northward.
Sunday, 20th. - A happy day, at the prospect of leaving this place to-morrow.
In the evening, our native, Charley, who shepherds the camels, reported that three had run away southward. He had followed the tracks for several miles, and one camel had broken its hobbles. This was bad news, but Halleem, the camel-man, requested to be allowed to go after them, and said he would bring them back. I lent him "Hosee," my riding camel, and he started a little before 5 p.m. I expected him to push on five or six miles, then camp for the night, and to run the tracks smartly at daylight on Monday, when he would overtake the runaways and bring them back by midday.
21st. - Looking every moment for Halleem and the camels. Sahleh, who had been seen walking in the vicinity of the camp with a gun, returned in the evening with the astounding intelligence that he had seen "Hosee's" return tracks, coming near the camp, and then branching off to the northward of east; he professed to be intimately acquainted with the tracks of each camel, and quite able to distinguish one from another. [188] This alarming news threw us into a maze of perplexity and doubt.
It was now also told me for the first time that Halleem was occasionally subject to fits, which rendered him quite unconscious of what he was doing, or where he was going. This made the matter worse, as such a man was unfit to be trusted alone, and it became a question whether Halleem had lost his camel or his wits; the latter seemed to me the more probable, as I could not believe that Hosee would come so near the other camels and not join them.
22nd. - I sent my son and Charley with a week's provisions on our back-tracks, to try for Halleem first; but, in the event of not finding his foot tracks, to continue on, and endeavour to recover the camels. Lewis also went in the other direction, to run up Hosee's tracks, so that I hoped that by one or other of these means I should learn what had become of Halleem. Unfortunately, Lewis, supposing he had only a few hours' work, took neither food nor water. Now, 6 p.m., it is beginning to rain, and Lewis has not returned. I know he will stick to the tracks as long as he can, but I wish he were back; if Halleem be demented, he may urge the camel on sixty or seventy miles without stopping, and thus get a start in his mad career that will make it impossible for Lewis to help him. [189]
23rd. - It has rained lightly all night. Lewis is still absent; I am greatly grieved at his having nothing to eat.
1 p.m. - Lewis returned; he had camped with Richard, and so was all right.
It appears from his report that Sahleh, whilst out "birding," must have stumbled upon a mare's nest, for Lewis soon abandoned the track he started on, and turned after Richard to find Halleem's first camp. They did not find this, but they fell on his tracks of next day, steadily following the runaway camels; it is clear, therefore, that Sahleh has done his countryman some injustice, and caused much unnecessary alarm. His mistake, however, has done good, for a second party is now out with food, which will relieve Halleem (when they find him) from starvation. Richard returned, having seen Halleem, and promised to take out provisions to meet him on his return.
24th. - Stormy; clouds and light rain. Found several more wells a short distance north of our camp. [190] We must have passed close to these on the 15th June without seeing them; it is scarcely possible to find these unmarked holes without some clue.
25th. - Cold, wet, and stormy; rain all night.
26th. - The weather cleared up. Sahleh shot an emu (Dromaius Novae Hollandiae) - a welcome addition to our larder. Every scrap of this bird was eaten up except the feathers. The liver is a great delicacy, and the flesh by no means unpalatable.
27th and 25th. - Sent provisions to Ethel Creek for Halleem.
29th. - The camel-hunters returned in the evening, but without the camels. This is a double loss; the camels are gone, and so is our time; our means of locomotion are much reduced, whilst the necessity of getting on is greatly increased. Halleem has, however, done all he could do; he followed the camels nearly 100 miles, but as they travelled night and day, whilst ho could only track them by day, he never could have overtaken them. No doubt these animals will go back to Beltana, where alarm will be created as soon as they are recognized as belonging to our party.
The bolting of the camels was caused by a young bull, who cut off two cows and drove them away before him. [191]
I had hoped to have been close to Perth by this time; how greatly have my expectations been disappointed! Difficulties and delays have beset us ever since the 23rd May, and but for these we should have been near our journey's end, for though we have not progressed, we have one way with another ridden 1700 miles.
30th. - Lewis, when last out, sunk a well about twelve miles from here, the only one out of nearly fifty in which water was procured. We started for it to-day. After deepening the well and cleaning out dead rats, we had not time to get the water before one whole side fell in, and the work had to be done over again. I hope we have now bid a final adieu to the Waterloo Wells; they have been as a city of refuge to us in our distress, but one does not wish to reside permanently in a city of refuge, however pleasant a short stay may have been. The day has been cloudy and threatening rain.
31st. - Travelled eighteen miles west-north-west. Bad ground and sand-hills. Weather cloudy, with a few drops of rain.
August 1st. - We continued the same general course for seventeen miles. [192] Weather very sultry; rain seems to be near. The spinifex is so slippery the camels cannot keep their footing on it. Rain in the morning, and continued all night.
2nd. - Raining still, so we did not move, and are thankful for it. It cleared up in the afternoon; the clouds are very low, and there was a fog at night.
Sunday, 3rd. - Halted for the day.
4th. - The camels were away in the morning, and we made a late start. Accomplished twenty-one miles in a direction a little north of west.
5th. - Travelled towards Mary Springs, passing a fine rock-hole, with water. Mount Russell, an isolated hill of no great altitude, but a good landmark for finding the rock-hole, lies south-west from the water, distant about twelve miles. Mary Springs is a notable place; it is the nearest permanent water on the boundary. The supply is abundant and easily got at, in a sandy gully between two sandstone hills. Unfortunately I have lost the book containing the calculations of astronomical observations, but to the best of my recollection the variation of the compass was so slight at Mary Springs (under thirty minutes) as to justify the belief that the line of no variation runs very close to that place. [193] This is the third time we have crossed into Western Australia; I hope our footing there is at last secure.
6th. - Pursued a north-west course for fourteen miles. Camped early, in consequence of finding tracks of natives, which gave promise of water not far off. Found a shallow clay pan about two miles to the west of our camp. We found good feed here for the camels, but the sand-hills appear to be increasing in number and size. We have got amongst the half-dried salt lagoons, so our further progress north-west is cut off. We must keep clear of these, or they may drive us still farther north.
7th. - A camel calved this morning. We cut the calf's throat and deferred the start till the afternoon. This is our second calf; the camel-men ate the first at Waterloo Wells. We started with full water-bags from the clay pan. Halted close by a salt lagoon, the edge of which looked as though we might get water by sinking. We are quite amongst salt lakes - a large one lies to the westward of us, sending out its arms to every point. [194] We must round the eastern end of them, as camels and salt bogs do not agree at all. The country in no respect so good as yesterday; still I hope to find a clay pan here and there.
5th. - We tried to cross the salt lagoon, but had to turn back. Went thirteen miles. Country is very bad - dense spinifex, high, steep sand-ridges, with timber in the flats, and nothing but the bushes that camels eat. Any man attempting to cross this country with horses must perish.
9th. - Travelled fifteen miles northward and westward. A strong easterly wind prevailed, blowing up clouds of sand and ashes from the burnt ground. Truly this is a desert! We camped on a salt lagoon, on the south side of which water was procurable, but it was quite salt.
Sunday, 10th. - Continued towards the northwest, to an isolated hill. Country opening out. Reached the mount at 12. p.m. We had great expectations of this place, but distance had deceived us - the hill is rubbish, and we obtained no hopeful view from it. There are signs of natives on some yarn-ground near it. From this place we continued our course towards an apparent gap in a broken basaltic range, and camped near it. [195]
11th. - I sent three parties out to look for water in different directions. Countless thousands of shell and other small parrots flew over the camp, disturbed by the riders. Our water-searchers returned in the afternoon unsuccessful, those who had examined the range pronouncing that part of the country hopeless for water. We were, however, induced to think there must be water somewhere in the direction taken by the third searcher, as he reported having seen flock-pigeons. He may have been mistaken, and the chance would have led us farther from the last water; so we should run the hazard of losing time and lengthening the distance, should our opinion prove wrong. I sent two men in the evening on our back-track, to see if they could trace to water the natives whose yam-digging marks we had seen yesterday at Yam Hill. This is our last chance; if it fail, we must go over those terrible sand-hills again to our last water! It will ruin the camels, and place us in an ugly predicament, but there is no alternative. I dare not work them on a chance. What they can do must be all on a certainty of getting water at the end. [196]
12th. - I took the party on our back-tracks to meet those I sent out yesterday evening, and found them at breakfast near Yam Hill. They had tracked the natives to their camp, near which they had a well. This is a blessing indeed to us. I had a perfect dread of again crossing the frightful desert we had got over. I trust that all may now be well with us for the present. The camels must have some days' rest, as they have not had their weekly spell for a long time.
13th. - Halt.
14th. - We ran up some blacks' tracks for twelve miles, discovered their well, and camped near a bluff. Found afterwards two other wells not far off.
15th. - On rounding the bluff a high hill came in view in front of us, towards which we travelled over pretty easy ground, which had been burnt. Near the bluff the country presented a more hopeful appearance, but it soon fell off into sandy desert. Camped about fifty-two miles south of the hill.
16th. - We had scarcely travelled five miles to-day before a thick smoke arose close before us. How the blacks let themselves into this trap I don't know; they never would have set fire to the country had they seen us so close. [197] Of course they paid the penalty of their carelessness, for we soon invaded their camp and took possession of an excellent well. This gave me an opportunity of fixing the camp for some days, whilst my son and I went out to see if we could find any break in the country to indicate the vicinity of Sturt Creek, discovered by A. C. Gregory in 1856. We started in the afternoon, and camped under a hill. Unfortunately my rough book, in which I worked my observations, has been lost, but I remember taking a lunar, which gave a longitude within four or five miles of that by account. I therefore concluded we must be somewhere near the salt lake into which Sturt Creek empties itself; and as this lake is stated to be only 300 feet above the level of the sea, whilst the barometer and our own convictions told us we must be on very high land, I had expected to find some very marked depression in the country.
17th. - Ascended the hill, but could see no sign at all of Sturt Creek or the lake. As far as eye could reach high land alone was visible. We had long been on elevated ground and were now on a high hill, but there was no fall in the country such as required by a lake on a low level. Went part of the way back to camp, having neither food nor water for further search. [198]
15th. - Returned to our standing camp. A reed-topped spear and an old iron tomahawk had been found in the camp of the natives, apparently significant of Sturt Creek not being very far off. [199]
19th. - My son and I started again north by east towards a high-looking range, in search of some signs of Sturt Creek. Travelled twenty miles over a most desolate, burnt country. Camels will eat almost all sorts of scrub, but we had difficulty in finding a mouthful for them here, and we ourselves were tormented all the afternoon and night by small black ants. We could get no firewood, so altogether had a pretty miserable time of it.
20th. - Continued our course towards the range, a gale of wind blowing the dust and ashes of the burnt ground in our faces. To our surprise, after travelling about seven miles, we struck a gum creek with good trees but no water. We had never anticipated such a find in such a vile country, but it did us no good. Reached the range and ascended the highest point, but there was no probability of such a lake as we were looking for. All was high table-land. Camped under the range.
21st. - We followed the gum creek through the range and ran it up to its head. Not a drop of water! Rode all day in different directions, looking for signs of the lake, but in vain. [200] Returned to the west side of the range through a long, bad gap, and camped near the same place as yesterday. We could not afford to spend any more time looking for the lake, and I presume there must be some error in the longitude. The Basaltic hills, looking very high from a distance, were there, but they were worse than useless, having no water near them.
I had been under an impression that these "fine Basaltic ranges," as they are called by Baron von Mueller, would lead us into a better country, but I was disappointed. Whatever they may be in good seasons, they are as bad as they could be now, and there is more hope of water in the sand-ridges than amongst these hills.
22nd. - Returning to our standing camp, we came upon some soft boggy ground on which the camels would not put a foot. It is a surface-water channel branching into the gum creek. In good seasons there must be water about, and I dare say we might have found it by digging, but we had no spade. It was dry enough for horses, but the camels would not cross it. Our return line was over a better country, and we camped within a few miles of our companions. [201]
23rd. - Reached the standing camp.
It would appear now that we were about ten miles east of the dry Salt Lake into which Sturt Creek empties itself. The sand-hills prevented our seeing it.
Sunday, 24th. - Halt.
25th. - Proceeded west-south-west, five miles, to a native well found by Lewis during our absence.
26th. - Thirteen miles west by south, to a well in black soil. It was a strong spring. We dug dogs' bones out of it, and when cleared it was a fine well. As far as we could judge the water is permanent.
27th. - Eighteen miles west. Ascended a small hill, hoping to see something cheerful. We were disappointed, but still I know there is no dependence to be placed on a cursory view from a height. The country may turn out better than it looks.
25th. - Travelling west. Lewis found a plot of ground where water was procurable at about a couple of feet. This would have been a fine place had we been in want of water, but we had some with us, and our great anxiety now was to get on. Crossed a large plain and saw, for the first time, flock-pigeons. They were very wild, and we could only kill three or four: These pigeons are excellent eating. [202] We have accomplished eighteen miles to day, and hope, from the change in the country, and the pigeons, to find something good soon.
29th. - Sent Lewis south of our course to examine a likely-looking place, and took the rest of the party fourteen miles west, camping between sand-ridges. Lewis, on his return, reported having found a glen and a beautiful pool of water. I had made preparations to go to this place, but in the evening, the existence of a lake ahead of us being reported, I thought it better not to go backward. I give the following extract from Lewis's account of the place he found, which I have called "Bishop's Glen :" - "After travelling six miles, we reached a beautiful clump of large gum-trees, growing in a swamp at the bottom of a small creek, which was hemmed in by a high sand-hill, and then ran through a rocky ridge in which there were fine, clear, deep water-holes 100 feet in circumference. The green foliage of the gum-trees contrasted pleasantly with the red sand-hills on either side, and the barren, rocky ridge in front. Bustard, bronze-wing pigeons, owls, and other birds were seen in the glen, and the whole formed a most gratifying sight after the dreary sand-hill country over which we have travelled. [203] [204]It was a sight which would well repay a few miles' journey in any country."
30th.-Proceeded thirteen miles north-north-west to a fine fresh-water lake - large, but not deep all over. [205] There were plenty of ducks, flock-pigeons, and parrots. This is indeed a rare treat to us, and, considering the present size of the lake, it must be very large (for fresh water) in a season when three months' tropical rain has fallen. [206]
31st. - Halted for the day. Shot all we could, but the lake is too large for good sport.
September 1st. - We left the lake, and at four miles west-north-west found another; this second was circular, with beautifully clear, fresh water resting on a pebbly bed. The shelving banks were dry, but there was a considerable body of deep water in the centre. From here we made fourteen miles, with very thick spinifex part of the way.
On the 30th, just before reaching the lake, we had captured a young native woman; this was considered a great triumph of art, as the blacks all avoided us as though we had been plague-stricken. We kept her a close prisoner, intending that she should point out native wells to us; but whilst we were camped to-day the creature escaped from us by gnawing through a thick hair-rope, with which she was fastened to a tree. We wore quickly on her tracks, directly we discovered our loss, but she was too much for us, and got clear away. [207] We had not allowed her to starve during her captivity, but she supplied herself from the head of a juvenile relation with an article of diet which our stores did not furnish.
2nd. - West again to-day, eighteen miles over bad sand-hills and rough spinifex. Ran up a smoke, and found a native well. There are hills in sight; those towards the north look high and hopeful, but they are quite out of our course. Other detached, broken hills lie to the west, so our intention is to go towards them.
3rd. - North-west by west, to a sandstone hill, but, arrived at the top, nothing was to be seen from it except several "hunting smokes" in different directions. Found a deep well in a gully some distance up the hill, but we could not use it, for, when cleared out, the sides fell, and it was dangerous for any one to descend.
4th. - Marched six miles west, and found a native camp and a well. Could not catch a native there, they being too quick for us; not far, however, from the camp a howling, hideous old hag was captured, and, warned by the former escape, we secured this old witch by tying her thumbs behind her back, and haltering her by the neck to a tree. [208] She kept up a frightful howling all night, during which time we had to watch her by turns, or she would have got away also. I doubt whether there is any way of securing these creatures if you take your eyes off them for ten minutes. North of us there is rather a good-looking range, running east and west, with a hopeful bluff at its western end; but I cannot go farther north whilst there is a hope of getting west.
5th. - Made eighteen miles westing over bad country - and no water.
6th. - Followed a general westerly course, eight miles. Smoke being seen a little to the south, we ran it up, and found a camp and well, but could not see any natives.
We let the old witch go. She was the most alarming specimen of a woman I ever saw; she had been of no use to us, and her sex alone saved her from punishment, for under pretence of leading us to some native wells, she took us backwards and forwards over heavy sand-hills, exhausting the camels as well as my small stock of patience. The well we found was in the opposite direction to the one she was taking us to.
Sunday, 7th. - I had hoped for a halt and a good rest for the camels, but our well turned out badly, being very deep, and containing not enough water for us or for a single camel. [209] We could not find anything better, so at sunset I sent the camels back to our last water, remaining myself with one companion at the camp, in charge of our baggage, and as our last well was not a good one, I fear the camels cannot get back for three days. This not only causes great loss of time, which is the same as loss of provisions, but it gives the poor camels too much extra work. We are now on short allowance of flour, and the camels have more before them than they can well do, so they do not stand in need of additional work by going back; there is, however, no help for it.
5th, 9th, and 10th. - I and my comrade remain at camp. At 11. a.m. the party and camels returned; there had been much difficulty and hard work in watering them, the supply being scanty, and it took a whole night as well as, the day to satisfy them. The heat is now very great, and the camels are suffering from travelling during the day over the hot sand and steep hills; we are therefore obliged to send them on in the evening, but I shall continue day travelling myself, as long as I can get a camel to stand up. [210] 
11th. - I started the baggage camels last night under Lewis. My son and I left this morning, and made twenty-one miles of westing, with no sign of water anywhere on the march.
Charley has been taking a turn round our camp, and reports a native well and a camp of blacks about four miles off. I shall start at day-light, so as to surprise their camp, and endeavour to catch one of the natives.
12th. - We reached the native camp, six miles distant, just at day-light, but our black-birds had taken wing. The wells are excellent; shallow, in a sandy hollow, with plenty of water. There is a small salt lagoon near us; it had some ducks when we arrived, but they declined our company. We got a few bronze-wing pigeons. There are two more small soda-holes near us. Baggage started when the moon rose.
13th. - My son and I found two dry wells and a dry tea-tree swamp. We reached our camp after a twenty miles' march. The Leichhardt trees are increasing in number and size. Casuarina trees there are none; oak few, but sand-ridges and spinifex continue to unabated vigour. The country, though very dry, is yet a little more hopeful, and though, perhaps, unable to find wells, we may be able to make them. [211] The weather is getting very hot; the natives cannot hunt far from water, we shall therefore turn north-west by north tomorrow, in hope of finding something.
Sunday, 14th. - Having no water to halt upon, we are obliged to move on. Baggage started with the moon; the course variable so as to cross the sand-hills at the easiest slope.
On reaching our camp eighteen miles distant, we found that the advance party had found a splendid well, or rather had made one in a good place; we have reason to be thankful, as this well saves us from going back over the stiff sand-hills we have crossed. The country has not improved, as I had hoped. I shall resume a west course to-morrow; my riding-camel has completely broken down, and could not bring me into camp to-day. She lay down, and we could only get her on her legs again by lighting some spinifex under her tail; but it was of no use, she could not travel, so I tied her to a bush and walked in.
I sent a man to lead in my camel; it is quite clear I must give up day travelling, the camels will be ruined by it. [212] [213]
15th. - Obliged to halt; our master bull camel has eaten poison, and is very ill; this animal is of immense value, not only on account of his great strength, but because without his aid we shall scarcely be able to keep the young bulls in order, and they may run off with all our camels Our lives almost depend on this sick camel. We have nothing to give the poor beast but a bottle of mustard, and that does not seem to do it much good. I hope a day's rest may help both it and my own riding-camel. At 4 p.m. the young bulls already began to be troublesome, and we are obliged to take extra precautions to keep them fast; the old one seems worse, will not be able to move to-morrow, and I cannot stay longer, for want of provisions. [214]
16th. - Made fourteen miles west. The old camel is unable to stand, so we are obliged to leave it. We cut a ramp down to the water in the well, that it might get water if it lived. [215]
Passed two small ponds strongly impregnated with soda. We have been obliged to knee-halter the young bulls.
17th. - Progressed fifteen miles towards the west, and reached a well found by one of the camel-men; it is a very poor one. The weather gets hot; this moment it is 104° under my fly.
By lunar distance taken yesterday on the march, our longitude was observed to be 124° 30' E.; by account it is 124° 37' 0'' E. Lunars are not much to be depended on, but as the two longitudes come near each other, I think their mean may approximate the truth, and if they don't, no great harm is done.
15th. - Made eleven miles more to the west. Obliged to abandon two riding-camels at our last camp; they could not stir. We at first thought they were poisoned, but it now appears that they have been struck in the loins by the night wind. My son's riding-camel is also struck, it cannot drag its hind legs after it, so we kill it here for meat instead of leaving it to die. What destruction to us! our strongest bull and three riding camels all gone in a day or so! What is to become of us, if this continue, I know not.
We do our best by covering their backs at night. [216]
The camel-men say the disease is common in their country; that it always comes in the night, and prevails when a certain star is in the ascendant but what star they cannot tell me, and as I am not a believer in the malign influence of the stars it does not much signify.
19th. - Happy to say we have no more sick camels this morning. We started so as to reach a smoke we had seen yesterday about ten miles off. Found a dry well, but the country at times very bad. We jerked our camel-meat as well as we could; but it is very poor food; the animal was old and quite worn out. The travelling these dark nights over such bad ground is necessarily very slow; hitherto I have allowed the sand-hills to be my guide; not only on account of the difficulty of crossing them, but also because the smokes we have seen have been mostly a little north of west; I cannot, however, go any farther with them, as they are running more to the north of west, whilst, my proper course lies a little to the south of it; and thus by and by I should have to cross them nearly at right angles, which would be ruinous. [217] [218]
Though now relieved from the immediate want of food, we are much in need of the camels; they suffer greatly from the heat, and cannot travel by day. As I will not move any farther from water on an uncertainty, we have decided in council to halt here to-morrow; two going out on camels to hunt for water on some tracks of natives we have seen this morning, and two more on foot to search towards the south. [219] Should both parties fail, then we must try a night march back to No. 86, get all the water we can there, and then press on next night to No. 84.
20th. - It is one year to-day since we left Adelaide! The two parties started as determined upon yesterday; owing to the reduced number (two only) and weak state of our riding-camels, we have been obliged to throw away the tents and most of our private property - keeping only guns and ammunition, and clothing enough for decency. The party on foot returned unsuccessful. They found a well, but could not dig to water, as the sand poured in from the sides faster than they could take it out.
At 1 p.m. Charley returned with news that they had tracked the natives round from northwest to south-west, and found their well. Lewis remained there to clear it out, and I shall move on towards it this afternoon, in time to water the camels.
Those only who have been in like circumstances can rightly estimate the blessing this well is to us; we should have been obliged to go back fifty miles, giving the camels an extra hundred before we could have recovered our present position, and we have neither time nor strength for so heavy an addition. [220] We ourselves are all quite well, but very hungry. Reached the well at 5.; it is a very fine one, and we watered all the camels.
21st - Closely as I am pressed for time, I think it best to remain here a few days. The season is one of drought, the country thickly covered with sand-hills and spinifex, the destructive heat makes it impossible to work our few camels during the day, and it is almost equally impossible to get over this rough ground in the dark. By remaining a few days I shall refresh the camels, and the waxing moon will help us over the ground; unfortunately I cannot make the best of my time, as I cannot use the camels to scour the country round our front.
22nd. - Halt. Our sick camel is not improving much, the others are doing well.
23rd. - Halt. A small bit of hoop iron sharpened at one end, like a chisel, has been found here; I can only suppose it to have been obtained from the kegs, which Mr. F. Gregory abandoned some twelve years ago on his way to Mount McPherson. Two of our party have been away to-day; they have just returned, and report the discovery of a good well about seven miles off. [221]
24th. - Cloudy, with a hot wind blowing; the flies innumerable to-day, which is a tolerably good sign of rain.
25th. - Travelled to-day parallel to the sandridges to the well, which we found to be a very good one.
26th. - Progressed nine miles. Richard is ill to-day; indeed we are all more or less afflicted with diarrhoea. The ants are very troublesome.
27th. - Made twelve miles, but met with no water; it is useless to go farther from our last water till we have secured another in front.
The sick camel that had detained me five days has now given in, although it has carried nothing for the last fortnight. Slight as our progress is the work is too hard for the camels, yet they are the most patient and enduring animals. We have now only eight left out of the seventeen we originally started with. A flock of wild geese flew over in the evening from the west; we hail it as a good omen; but our speculations have not as yet turned out very happy ones.
Sunday, 25th. - Halt to-day for the purpose of trying the country all round for water before we turn back; as we must do if unsuccessful. I sent out two of the party to search. The sand-hills are running us down too much to the north, but we cannot cross them in the dark without great danger to our camels. [222] In addition to the common flies which are quite bad enough, and the ants which nearly eat us up, we have the Australian bee or honey-fly to torment us. These insects stick to one most perseveringly, and though they don't sting, they smell badly, which is perhaps the reason they persist in walking up our nostrils.
Our water-searchers returned unsuccessful. Painful as retrogression is, it is the only safe course under the circumstances in which we are placed, so that in ten days we shall only have made a few miles progress. We are now on very short allowance, and seem to have the prospect of starvation before us.
29th. - Started with the moon. Halted when she sank and went on again in the morning. Reached camp No. 90 by 9. a.m. on Monday the 29th. We saw nothing of the knocked-up camel we had left on Saturday, and suppose it had turned aside to die. We crossed the tracks of two natives this morning, and shall endeavour to run them up.
30th. - Sent Lewis and Charley at daylight to follow up the native tracks; Oharley returned at 10 a.m. with news of a good well about five miles to the north-west. [223] Lewis stayed at the well to save the camel.
Took the party to the water in the evening; it is by far the best we have seen for months; it is more a rock-hole than a well, though it is certainly fed by a spring.
October 1st. - An immense number of bronze-wing pigeons came to water at this hole, but they are most difficult to get; we are obliged to shoot for the pot as our supply of ammunition will not allow of reckless or doubtful shots.
Our hopes are raised at finding a different class of water, and although it has taken us down to latitude 200 2', we must follow its line; our great disadvantage lies in being unable to make any extensive search in our front for want of camels, or to travel by day on account of the heat, which utterly prostrates them; when we move we can't see, when we stop we can't search.
Travelled ten miles west along the flat, then camped, as one of the riding-camels got lame.
Night cloudy, with a suffocating heat; the ants enjoy this weather, the creatures never sleep, and won't let us either.
2nd. - It is very hot to-day, but less cloudy. [224]
Two of the party went out on foot a few miles, and saw several smokes, but no water; the smokes were most probably many miles farther than they appeared to be, and trudging over these hills of loose burning sand is enough to kill a strong well-fed man. A very short walk is all we can manage.
