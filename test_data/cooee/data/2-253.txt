Written to P.F. Campbell, Patrick's Plains, Hunter River, N.S.W.
Parramatta, May 27th, 1842
My dear Pat,
I would have written to you before but I have had sad troubles since in money matters. The Oats and other things you sent for you will receive next week. I bought the oats I wrote to you about from A.B. Smith and ordered to be sent that evening per the Steamer. It must be at least five weeks since but I suppose through some mistake they were not sent. However I have given directions that three bushels should be added to the former quantity 12 bushells and sent in immediately with the other things.
I have given Isabella an order to get them so I am starting for Bathurst in about two hours and she will write to you when to send for them. I wish it was in my power to assist you more substantially but I look forward when we shall be able to render assistance to each other as Brothers ought.
Hoping all your family are well, Believe me my dear Brother, Yours affectionately, Dal. Campbell
Excuse the scrawl I'm in a hurry.
