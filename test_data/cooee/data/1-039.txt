Parramatta
August 24th 1794.
Dear Madam,
You will probably have heard before this reaches England of our safe arrival in New South Wales. We have much to bless the Lord for who conducted us safe through the mighty waters and brought us to our. the desired haven. I wish I had a greater sense of the Divine mercies and were more humbly dependent upon the goodness of Providence and Grace.
We are now pretty comfortably settled at Parramatta and shall not be removed to Norfolk Island while Major Grose is Lieut. Governor. You will have heard of Mr. Johnson 's quarrel with the present Lieut Governor and how uncomfortably we are situated in point of Religion. Mr. Johnson informs me that things in that respect were never anything like so bad as at present, there is so little attention paid even to mere morality. The differences between Mr. Johnson and the Lieut. Governor hath gone to a very great length which renders it exceedingly unpleasant to me as it gives me a degree of pain when in company with either of the contending parties, as I am constrained then to be under a sort of necessity of being guarded in my expressions. I am resident about 14 miles from Mr. Johnson and have to preach at several places, but have no church at any of them. I bless God my congregation is constantly increasing, and two or three have begun to enquire what they must do to be saved. I hope our present dark night is the womb of a bright morning, not that I expect to see so many turned from Darkness to Light. yet I have no doubt hut He will own and bless his word to the eternal salvation of some of these unhappy people. Nothing can be done at Sydney while Mr. Johnson and the Governor are so at variance. The Lord will arise by and by & our enemies will be scattered. [7] 
Things are better upon the whole than I expected to find them among such abandoned people. I am not surprised to see them cast such contempt upon God and Religion knowing the human heart to he so full of enmity to Christ and his Gospel. What gives me the greatest uneasiness is the unhappy differences which prevails between Mr. Johnson and the Lieut. Governor. As I enjoy some privileges which Mr. Johnson at present does not this hurts him a good deal. Though I am favoured no more than any other officer, or than Mr. Johnson was before he quarreled with Major Grose, yet to see the Governor pay me more attention than he does him gives him much pain. Mr. Johnson has been treated unkindly. I must and will take his part, in what I see he is right, but then I must not, it is not my duty to he at variance with the Governor here if I can consistant with my duty and conscience avoid it. I cannot describe our situation: it is such an uncommon one. All the higher ranks are lost to God and Religion, and you may so form an idea of the characters of the lower orders.
While we were at Mr. Johnsons their house was broken open and a good quantity of sugar was stolen belonging to Mrs. J. and 70 lb. of Coffee belonging to me I had also 6 pairs of shoes stolen from me to by Mr. Johnsons servant. We do in the literal sense dwell amongst lions.
Mrs. M is very well and our little daughter. She desires her kindest love to you. She will write probably to you by the next ship. Present my respects to Mr. Stokes.
I am
Dear Madam
Yours &c &c
