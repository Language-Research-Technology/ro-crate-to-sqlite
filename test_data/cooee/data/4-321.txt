To the electors of New South Wales. - An election is upon us, and again you are called upon to exercise the all-important privilege of selecting and returning to Parliament men who can be relied upon to make laws which are based upon justice, and which favor no class. Labor has closed up its ranks, united in one political organisation, and now appeals to all workers and true democrats to rally for the coming struggle.
You are asked not to be turned aside by the plausible promises or statements of the old parties, whose misrule has blighted this otherwise splendid country. The position of the toiling masses to-day is a sufficient proof of the incapacity of the political parties of the past, and ample justification for adding to the number of the Labor Party, until it is strong enough to take up the work so long neglected and enact laws based on equity and the common good. In the Parliament just ending the Labor Party have sat for the first time in the history of New South Wales as a united body. Through a tempestuous and difficult session in face of perpetual misrepresentation, and in spite of the utmost efforts of enemies to sow dissension in our ranks, we have preserved our unity unshaken and entire. We stand to-day as strong to the last man as when we entered Parliament. As the result of our presence and our unity, the Government of the day have been compelled to do what no Government has done before, not merely to pass a large instalment of reform through the Legislative Assembly, but also to call upon the people to enforce the acceptance of such reform by the Council.
This Parliament differs from former ones only in the presence of a solid and independent third party. To this cause alone can be attributed the democratic awakening. The absence of the third party would be inevitably followed by a return to the legislative slumbers of the past. Four years ago the Labor Party laid before the workers of this country a platform, the two main planks of which were land value taxation and the abolition of the Upper House. Outside their ranks no solitary voice was then raised in favor of either step. To-day the whole country has learnt to support the one measure, and the whole country finds itself unable to secure it because it has not yet learnt to support the other. The people have declared with no uncertain sound for the destruction of monopoly in land. Their constitutionally and moderately expressed decision has been flouted by a handful of irresponsible nominees of Dibbs and Parkes. These unrepresentative individuals - largely interested in the abuses which they strive to maintain-have been permitted to usurp the function which should be the privilege of the people alone - that of revising the decision of their representatives through the medium of the referendum. The attitude of the Labor Party on this point, as on others, is unchanged. The party would never consider an elective Upper House as reform, but in the event of being unable to secure its immediate abolition and the substitution of the referendum, would be inclined to support any measure curtailing its power and taking from it the power of veto.

We call upon the workers of New South Wales to remember that it is to the exertions of their own representatives that what has already been achieved is due, and we appeal to them for undivided and willing support in the great struggle now impending with the last champions of intrigue and oppression. The removal of this bar will at once make it easy for the people's representatives in the Assembly to bring improved conditions to every farmer, artisan, and other worker. They will then bc able to shift the undue burden of taxation from the workers to the wealthy class, strike monopoly at its root, and by the establishment of a State Bank help the settlers and other workers with cheap money to build up homes and independence.
The one question before the electors is whether their wishes shall govern the country or not. The hollowness of the old controversy of protection and freetrade is proved, if further proof were wanting, by the degrading spectacle which we have witnessed this session of the foremost protectionist and the most prominent freetrader joining hands in an unprincipled set amble for office. They sank the "fiscal issue" on that occasion, and will do so again in defence of their interests. The workers can and must do the same in defence of theirs.
The other differences which unfortunately divided us at the last election have also been happily reconciled. From the furthest border of New South Wales to the very heart of Sydney the Labor Party now stands without a breach in its ranks or a rent in its organization. It needs only that your energy and unanimity should second ours to secure the continued triumphant progress of the workers' cause.
Yours in the Cause of Humanity,
F. Flowers President.
I. Routley, General Secretary.
