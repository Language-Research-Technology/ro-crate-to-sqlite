Sydney New South Wales
August 20th 1820.
My dear & esteemed Mrs. Stokes
My Mother received your affectionate letter dated April 3rd 1820 last week, & is happy to find that notwithstanding you complain of the indolence attending old age you are enabled to write to & think of her and hers for my part I find it very difficult to fancy you what you represent yourself as, "very old & infirm." I can only remember you as the kind indulgent Mrs. Stokes, endeavouring to satisfy my childish curiosity by accompanying me into various toy shops, on my first arrival in England; & presenting me with the largest doll I had ever seen What a treasure I thought I was possessed of. Twenty years have rolled away since those events happened & made them "the tale of other times." I am very happy to say we have received the box of bonnets etc safe : it was packed in a case of books directed to the Missionaries in New Zealand, which place it would have gone to, had not the Rev. Mr. Hill received intelligence that he had some letters in the case, & wished it to be opened, when our box was discovered. The parcel which you mention to have sent, I fear we shall never receive, for the young man whose care it was intrusted to forwarded it in his box by the Saracen, which ship sailed from Sydney before his arrival. Mr. Hill delivered the letter & boxes which you sent by him, for which we return you many thanks. I think you would be surprised to see my dear brother in England, it was a great trial to my Mother to part with him, but it was obliged to be so, or he never would have received an education to have enabled him to support the character of a gentleman. We conceived ourselves highly favoured in being permitted to receive accounts of him within 10 months after his departure. My Mother is surprised to find he has had measles, as she thought he had that disorder when he was with her on board the Buffalo. I am sure you will feel much sorrow on Mr. Thos Hassall's account, to hear of the death of his Father, he died after a very short illness, but that was of no moment with him, for I comprehended he was many years prepared for his great change, whenever it should please his Master to call him. [76] A Bible society has been established lately at Parramatta & a female committee is also formed to act in conjunction with it. I am proud to say the ladies prosper the best. We collect about £5 monthly. The people evince a greater readiness to pay free subscriptions; they do not appear anxious to possess a Bible; our greatest expectations are from the rising generation. We have, I am happy to say, a good Sunday School, about 110 children attend constantly. The little black children make rapid improvement. The girls can read fluently & write & sew very neatly. You have of course heard before that though my Father went out in the Dromedary to New Zealand, he is not returned yet, although he has been absent six months : we are now daily expecting him. Mr. Cartwright is anxiously awaiting the arrival of Mrs. C from England. Mr. Youl was very unwell the last time we heard front him; his health has been very indifferent for many months past, he is extremely subject to an inflammation on the lungs. We are all just recovering from a severe cold which is very prevalent throughout the Colony. My Mother was exceedingly ill for some days, & also Elizabeth; they unite with me in kindest regards to Mr. & Mrs. Hughes & affectionate love to yourself & believe me,
Your very affectionate
ANNE Marsden
