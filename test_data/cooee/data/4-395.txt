We have a spare room which is occupied by boarders and in this way we are able to put a little in the bank every week, although rents are very high; imagine 20s. per week for a five bedroom cottage. This makes a hole in a fellow's screw to begin with. 
I forgot the mention that I got the promised rise of 5s. but is not likely to be able to get another for sometime owing to a standard wage being the ruling of the firm which in my opinion is a very bad idea. There is no encouragement for further advance. However my purpose is to stick to it and save what I can as I intend someday going squatting. It pays better than being behind the counter providing one has a little cash to make a start with. This was my only reason why I did not go to Gippsland when I left Bendigo; would not be afraid to make it pay if I only got a fair start and we did not wish to be any encumbrance on Hugh. He had a hard beginning and struggles through honourably. 
Sunday 23. During the week I was offered another situation in one of the largest houses in Perth (William Sandover & Co.). The salary is the same but there is promises of a rise according to ability. As I have already mentioned there was no further prospect of a rise in the Union Store having reached the standard wages. This is not so in Sandovers. I prefer living in Fremantle to Perth. However we will not move from here until the summer is over.
