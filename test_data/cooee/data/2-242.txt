Dear sir, 
From the general tenor of my last Letter written in February last: and also from other communications more weighty and important than my own, you perceive what a lamentable state our Mission is in. And is gradually becoming more and more so. My present object, in writing you, is not to repeat what has been so often stated and so largely entered upon by others more capable of doing it than myself: but it is simply concerning myself and the situation I hold in connection with your Society. From my many communications dear sir, I suppose the Home Society to be quite aware, how disappointed I have been since I have entered upon my duties at this Mission. It is true sometimes I have indulged a hope that I might see a change of things, which has stimulated me to a greater exercise of faith and patience: but alas: I feel that I cannot now indulge a hope of that kind. Therefore, after much Prayer for Divine Guidance, after much deliberation, and with very great reluctance, do I tender the resignation of my situation as Agriculturist to this Mission. 
To be more explicit, I would observe that there are three things which principally induce me to leave this Missionary field of labour. The first is the very great discouragement I have met with in my Agricultural pursuits. This is the fourth season I have cultivated and sown our Paddocks with Wheat and have never received any return, except about one third of a crop of Wheat last year - about seven Bushels to the acre. This season I have bestowed more than common care and attention in ploughing and sowing. The grain came up beautifully, grew until it was about six inches high. The drought set in - soon dried it up, and now any hopes are once more blasted, and my labour and care entirely lost. The drought still continues and our distress is becoming very great for Cattle and Sheep are suffering very much for want of food and Water. Indeed, should it please God, that the drought should continue a few months longer, the distress will be unparalleled in the history of the Colony. 
The second thing that I shall mention which induces me to take the present step - is that I am obliged to employ very improper characters as domestic servants on the Mission Farm, as the Corresponding Committee will make no efforts to procure more suitable persons for us. In addition to the above mentioned reasons there is another which under more favourable circumstances of an Agricultural nature would still incline me to take the step I am now doing. It is the great and unceasing wish, to exchange my secular employment for a spiritual one. I have no secondary motive in wishing to do this. I have only one motive, and that is I wish to spend my life as a Preacher of the Gospel. I am not tired of the Missionary life; on the contrary, I have a stronger desire to be a real Missionary, than I ever had before: notwithstanding the trials and disappointments I have met with here. I wish the Society to understand that I have no wish to leave their connection if they think me a proper person to undergo such a course of study as would put me for the sacred office of a Minister of the Gospel. Should the Society be unable to do this, I must then (Please God) return to my friends in England, as I am unwilling to continue here as an Agriculturist. 
Waiting a reply at your earliest convenience. 
I remain, dear sir, 
Your Obedient Servant 
William Porter
