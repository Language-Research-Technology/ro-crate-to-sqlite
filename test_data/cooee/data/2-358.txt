I myself was suffering severely at one time from a most excruciating, deep-seated whitlow on one of my fingers, and had to suffer from it for a week before he (i.e. the doctor) could attend me; but just before his arrival relief was afforded me by a friendly chemist, a visitor for the night, who lanced the finger for me; but a joint was lost through the delay. On another occasion I was thrown from my horse about two miles from home and dislocated an elbow and both wrists and sprained an ankle. In this state I crawled home, where I lay for three days before the doctor could reach me, but the dislocations were reduced in a few minutes when he did come; but all cases were not of so urgent or painful a character as these.
