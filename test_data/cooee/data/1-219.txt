THE RESPECTFUL ADDRESS AND HUMBLE MEMORIAL OF THE LANDHOLDERS, MERCHANTS AND OTHER FREE INHABITANTS OF VAN DIEMEN'S LAND
To the King's most excellent Majesty.
May it please your Majesty,
We have viewed also with anxious attention the Consideration given by your Majesty's Ministers to the general and individual Interests of the people of this Island, and have learned with the liveliest Satisfaction their solicitude on our behalf, as more especially manifested by the introduction of the Clause in the late Act of Parliament contemplative of the elevation of this Island to a separate and independent Colony.
That this Island, originally considered as a mere penal Settlement, has under the benign auspices of your Majesty's Government, and especially during the Administration of Lieutenant Governor Sorell, progressively advanced in improvement as regards its internal economy and has attained a corresponding importance in its external relations.
That the increased tide of Emigration, so wisely directed to its Shores by your Majesty's Ministers, and bringing along with it so considerable an influx of Capital, has infused an active spirit of agricultural and pastoral improvement, has enlarged the facilities of Trade, and stimulated commercial enterprize, and must necessarily tend to the rapid developement of the great natural resources of the Country.
That these resources in some respects almost unlimited are in general so important and valuable, as to render the Colonists entirely independent of any supplies or assistance from New South Wales, to whose necessities moreover they have happily been able to administer; whilst the large acquisition of respectable population, of Capital, and of operative skill, leads them to contemplate a higher state of Society within themselves, and a comparative extension of commercial intercourse with other parts of the world, to the various quarters of which their productions or their Money have already found their way.
That, although the people of this Island have had to combat with all the difficulties incident to a new Country, without many of the aids and facilities enjoyed by the Colonists of New South Wales, they have nevertheless made proportionably greater advances. But, as, in Soil Climate and Geographical relation, this Island essentially differs from that Country, as its present State, moral and physical, cannot be referred to the same Causes, neither can their future welfare and prosperity be identified with or promoted by the same policy and measures, and which, however applicable and advantageous they may be to that Settlement, have been recently felt alike unsuited to the Condition and prejudicial to the welfare of this Colony. [343] 
And we most humbly submit to your Majesty that the true Interests of this Colony, its agricultural, pastoral and commercial prosperity, can be rightly understood, protected and encouraged only by the observation, experience and solicitude of a resident Government, acting by wise Counsels and not subject to the Controul or dependent on the authority of the local Government of New South Wales.
The deep interest we feel in the stability and future prosperity of this land of our adoption, we presume to plead with your Majesty in excuse of this lengthened memorial of our dearest hopes and wishes, and most respectfully renewing the expression of our sincere Loyalty and Attachment to your Majesty's sacred person and Government, and our heartfelt Gratitude for the Benefits already conferred upon us through your Majesty's Grace and favor.
We most humbly pray that your Majesty may be graciously pleased to take the same into your Royal and Paternal Consideration and to constitute and erect the island of Van Diemen's Land into a separate Colony, independent of the Government of New South Wales.
And your Majesty's Memorialists and dutiful and loyal Subjects, as in duty bound, shall ever pray, etc., etc., etc.
