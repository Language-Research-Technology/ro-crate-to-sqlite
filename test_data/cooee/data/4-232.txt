 [...] With reference to poor David you will all be pleased to know that we had them for some time especially his wife. On going to Melbourne to see them sometime after they arrived I then found her in such a state of health that would necessitate the abandonment of house duties in a very short time. I then purposed to David for them to come and stay with us until she got over her trouble. This offer was solely on his account and as a brother I could not think of them staying with strangers. They came here about 29th September. David knocked about for 8 or 10 days until I procured him a situation with a farmer about 21 miles from here. Time passed on and a baby boy was born early in November. They are both doing well. They remained here for three weeks, are now living in a nice cottage on the farm where David is working. I do pity David poor fellow, he is badly mated but he has made the choice and will have to submit to the consequences. [193] It is to be hoped they will stay where they are for a long time. I assure you I don't want her company here again. You are quite right when you say she talks and tells things she has no right to and things that never happened. She had the cheek to tell me that you were all offended because I married. I asked her what grounds she had for saying so but she would give me no reason. However in the course of her talk and story making she told Maggie or Maggie's mother that you were all offended at us all for thinking of marrying, that you wanted us to remain single so that you would get our earnings, thus classing David. She need not have made up any such yarns for I knew to the contrary. 
Without doubt David has been stuffing them (the Kyles) with information to suit himself. On hearing him talk I could see that it was all a one sided story from beginning to end. Despite all this I could not see them homeless and gave them the best I could afford and put them on square footing for themselves. I hope he will make the best of it. I don't want to have her here again I have been cut to the bone repeatedly. I do not wonder at the steps father took although I thought it hard at first but it is evident that David has played the part of an undutiful son as well as doing that which is injurious to himself. It was no little that made father part with his last son now in his old age just when he wanted help. I was just saying to Maggie the other day if I had not been stuck up with this business I would not have thought twice about going home to work the farm. It is an awful thing that father is so badly situated. William wrote to me some time ago asking my advice but I reserved it. However as I am writing to headquarters will venture to give my advice although not asked for. My advice is for father to put the farm in crop and sell it on foot and then dispose of the land stock and implements. He will surely be able to get as much for it as will keep those at home comfortable the remainder of their days. What is this life to mother and him if they cannot take it easy when they are old and infirm. I feel sure you would all have your health better if you were to live privately in some nice healthy little cottage. Now dear Susannah this is now the last Sunday in 1890. I began my letter a few days ago but have been kept so busy that I could not get time to finish it. However as my work is cut out for every night to the end of the year I thought I could not spend it better than stay at home from church and finish this epistle. 
Another Christmas has gone. Who will be spared to see the next. God alone knows. We have been thinking about sending some little thing to mother and poor aunt as Christmas presents but things are so very tight and money scarce that we have not been able to afford it. However it is to be hoped that we will be able before long to send some little thing. 
The strike has been pretty hard on me owing to my business being cash. However it is to be hoped that business will stir up after harvest.
