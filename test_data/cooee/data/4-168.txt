[...] better for her to take a trip to Victoria if the doctor thinks well of it. It is with much pain that I make the suggestion as, no doubt, you will think that she will not come home again. But we don't mean that, we simply mean that she could come away (as Hugh suggests) not later than the autumn early in October. By doing so she would escape the winter and land here about the middle of November before the very hot weather would set in and then if she thought well of it could return before winter would set in here. [175] In the meantime we have agreed (I mean Hugh and I) to send home £10 each or so which would make £20. With this you can use to her benefit as you think best. We cannot offer her much encouragement to come here as none of us has a home of our own and has to depend on the strangers for everything. But we are willing to do the best in our power for her if she comes. I don't know that she ever mentioned the idea of coming, but perhaps she was waiting until we would suggest it. This I did not like to do knowing what a trial it is for both parties. 
I would give it as my opinion that there will not be much good health for any of the delicate members of the family while there is so much wet around the house. I am now speaking from experience. You all know how I used to whistle and cough during the winter months. Well I can tell you I never have a cough. I mean a cough that sticks to me. No doubt people will catch colds here but they can shake it off. I took a cold last July and also one this July with a sore throat but I blamed shaving and nearly everybody had it. I used a little eucalyptus oil and a piece of new flannel round my neck and was soon well again.
