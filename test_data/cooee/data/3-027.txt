November 20 1851
My Dear Eliza,
I received yours of the 16th Inst. last night and beg to give you warning that if you continue to write in the same strain you will dispel all my stern and morose disposition and more than ever charm me in love and affection.
I am very pleased to hear of Matilda and Janet's progress and the boys I doubt not are as well behaved and as obedient to you as we could expect. It has just occured to me that we ought to have recalled Kenneth so that he might have been at Grass Dale during the fruit season. He would be as vigilant and useful as any person you could hire and I fear all will be stolen if a strict watch is not kept. I expect John Taylor in a day or two. He told me that he intended going to Champion Bay almost immediately, and if so I will write to both Kenneth and Thomson and if Kenneth can be spared I see no reason why he should not return to assist during the fruit season. He would also be of use in assisting you in removing to Fremantle. I am afraid I shall be unable to render you much assistance in getting the goods down, for although I may not be without plenty of kind friends to take my duty occasionally yet the principle part or the whole of the correspondence would be left for me so that it will be very difficult to leave, as an accumulation of such matters would be perplexing and probably lead me into confusion.
I merely make the above suggestions for your consideration and if opportunity offers will send my letter to Kenneth for your approval as I should be sorry for him to return unless you felt that he could either improve himself or be of use in the way I have suggested.
I am sorry you were disappointed in not hearing from me by Post last week but very glad to hear of your anxiety on the subject. You will by this time have found out the reasons of my not writing per Perth, viz I wrote by Cowan. I heard a very interesting lecture last night at the Court House by Dr. Barry on the Poets of the Present Century. I cannot help thinking how much Kenneth would have been benefited by the recital of some of the poetry and the allusions and comparisons drawn by the lecturer.
If you find that you can manage it try to drive up and see Mr and Mrs Wittenoom and ask them to dine with you. Monger could let you have 1 / 2 a cwt. of potatos which would come in useful in the event of the Governor or any other person coming in accidentally.
I called yesterday to pay my respects to Mrs. Fitzgerald about 4 oclock and confess I did not feel the dressings* that some complain of in morning calls and afterwards waited upon Mrs. Bruce as in duty bound having dined them last week. [125] I next went to call upon Mrs. Irwin but not finding her at home left a card, afterwards met with her at Courthopes where I called for some magazines. I have paid a quarter subscription to the book club and shall read as much as my time will allow. I have Chambers Edinburgh Journal at present and begin it tonight. I wish you were here to read to me.
Nov. 21
An accumulation of business prevented my continuing your letter yesterday and in the evening Mr. F. Wittenoom informed me that Dr. Barry was to deliver a lecture on Astronomy at the Methodist Chapel at eight oclock and asked me to accompany him. I at once said it would give me great pleasure to hear Dr. Barry on Astronomy and under his, F.W's, wing I would venture to enter the chapel. Away we went, were received and ushered through the chapel to the upper seat with great ceremony, but O we had an awful infliction. "Tell it not in gath". When all was over I accompanied Mr. W home. He produced some bread and cheese and with a stiff glass of brandy and water we endeavoured, but without success, to forget the past. How Wittenoom has slept during the night I know not but must call and enquire for him on my way to the Court House. The consequence of all this is you have lost a long letter and I some delightful reading. I wish you were here to read to me.
Viveash was here yesterday and took a chop with me. Mrs. Viveash is poorly. He has been expecting to see me for some time and I have promised to ride up some night and return next morning.
Mr. Bussell and some others are preparing for the gold diggings.
I remain
Dear Eliza ever affectionately
Thos Brown
P S Some cards were sent here for you from the Clifton Family. I opened them to see what they were like and enclose them.
If I see Taylor I will get him to call on you for letters for Kenneth.
