To Colonel Warburton.
SIR, - We who are now present, acting not only for ourselves, but for those belonging to our community who are prevented from being present on this auspicious occasion, beg to offer you and your party a sincere, warm, and hearty welcome to this the North District of Western Australia, and to congratulate you that, after boldly planning and undertaking the conduct of an expedition through a vast, arid, and totally unknown portion of Central Australia, you have nobly encountered and overcome difficulties and dangers of all kinds, which up to this time were apparently insurmountable, and have finally risen victorious over all obstacles without having sacrificed the life of even one human being to your heroic enterprise.
This is a result for which we cannot be too thankful to an ever-watchful and Omnipotent Providence, and it is our opinion that the indomitable pluck, energy, and perseverance shown by yourself and party have entitled you to the lasting gratitude of the inhabitants of your own and neighbouring colonies. [303] That your wanderings should have terminated in this district is a matter of congratulation to us, as we cannot but feel that the pastoral and mineral capabilities of our adopted country only required to be viewed and reported upon by a competent and disinterested person, for the natural result to follow of a large influx of settlers and stock to our vast pastoral lands, and of miners and capital to our neglected minerals.
"In conclusion, we beg to reiterate our hearty welcome to yourself and party, and trusting that you will soon be re-united to your expectant families and friends in South Australia, have the honour to subscribe ourselves, sir,
Your sincere well-wishers,
R. P. Sholl.
H. W. VENN.
FREDK. PEARSE.
P. RUTHERFORD RYLEY." &c., &c.
