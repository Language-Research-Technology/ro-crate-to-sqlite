J. Shortland, Jun., To J.Shortland, Sen. 
HMS Reliance, Sydney Cove, Port Jackson, 
10th September, 1798.
My Dear Father, About a twelvemonth since I went on an expedition in the Governor's whaleboat as far as Port Stephens, which lies 100 miles to the northward of this place. In my passage down I discovered a very fine coal river, which I named after Governor Hunter. The enclosed I send you, being an eye-sketch which I took the little time I was there. Vessels from 60 to 250 tons may load there with great ease, and completely landlocked. I dare say, in a little time, this river will be a great acquisition to this settlement. The short time I remained at this river we had rain, which prevented my doing so much as I otherwise should.
