I put off writing this day week as I was very tired. Although we have not a long day we have to work pretty hard and constant while we are there. This is now the busy season coming on to the summer, so we have not many idle minutes from we go in until we come out. Add to that the bustle, fuss and confusion and it makes a heavy enough day's work, but it is ever so much better to be busy than have too little to do. 
One has to be pretty particular about one thing and another as there are often mistakes occur. It is a very complicated kind of town to send parcels in as there are so many names of suburbs and so many ugly long-spelled native names one has always to be on their guard; at least that is my experience.
