I have been miles away in the bush camped for the last three weeks. It is simply glorious. I was out in a paddock shooting kangaroos but we (cousin Frank and I) only made out expenses. The fellows from the tin fields poached them all out of it. I have to pay £5 for the use of the paddock for one year and when we paid our £5 each we found we had just cleared ourselves. But you see we can go in the paddock now anytime in the year and will make pounds if the skins still keep going up in price. We have given them a rest just now for a month or two as I am going fencing as jackaroo or man of all works to two other fellows [...] 
My first kangaroo I shot off hand at 150 yards. He stood nearly 6 feet high. I shot a brush or silver grey kangaroo before I shot this one but we don't reckon them as being kangaroos they are so small. 
I am going on peelers (mounted) but won't be called for a bit yet (pay up to £10 per month) for a common peeler. Mr. Wright when he was on got £15 a month and would have been a judge by this time if he hadn't took to liquor.
