[...] he says he is much disappointed with the country; there is many a one like him. Their idea of the country is that they have nothing to do but walk into a large store and ask for a situation believing that they have little or nothing to do and get a large salary. This is a very erroneous idea. Situations are hard to get especially in Melbourne being overrun with people from other colonies and when a situation is obtained you have got to work pretty hard, at least harder than Sam was ever used to in the old country. For my part I don't think I've got to work as hard as I did at Riddels. The only drawback here (or at least in Agnew's) is that the discipline is bad.
