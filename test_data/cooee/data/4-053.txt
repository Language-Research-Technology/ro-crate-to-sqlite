I know my love is doing his very best. To do the best is all you can do, and I am sure you'll make a good thing out of it. It must take time. You are a very short time there and must expect it to be uphill work for some time but I feel assured you will make it profitable in time if it is possible to do so, my Alick. I was indeed pleased to read your mother's letter my darling. We'll hope in time your father will write as cheerfully too. Maybe my darling your father unknowingly has done what is the kindest thing to both you and me. He has prevented us living in Ireland and it may be that Ireland was not the place for either of us; it did not suit your health, that had been proved. I was untried and very young as well. I have been brought up in a warm climate and though not delicate, yet not strong, and it might have brought back the tendency to a weak chest which I am outgrown quite. And Australia agrees with you, my husband dear, you know it does, and once the pecuniary trouble is removed from the station a comfortable happy home can be made, and a happy life enjoyed, and time will bring more population. The land must in time become private property and it will be impossible for people to have such enormous runs. So looking at it in this light only, yours and my health, we see one good coming from your father's opposition. There are other blessings too, but I have spoken of them before to you. The waiting is hard, the trial of separation severe we both know, but all trial all troubles are for wise purpose and I think we should look at it as such.
