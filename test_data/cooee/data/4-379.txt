 [...] strange how news of that kind travels. However I am pleased to say there was nothing dishonourable about it. It was caused by that over which I had no control. If anyone is asking about me you can truthfully say that I sold out (which I did for the benefit of my creditors) and went to Western Australia. The words bracketed and underlined need not be mentioned. I am exceedingly sorry I did not come here 2 1/2 years ago. However must make the most of things now. 
You will be pleased that I have got a start in the already mentioned stores. It is the largest place here being the retail shop for Bateman and Sons who own the largest wholesale place in Western Australia. I did not get position I wanted or was qualified to fill but hope to get to the top most rung of the ladder. They are few and far between who can give me a point here. The department I am now in is the furnishing and I have already made myself felt although I have just completed my third week last Saturday. The manager of the builder's ironmongery wants me badly as second sale. This will come off as the manager of the firm has promised that I should go there after stocktaking which is now on. 
Fremantle as you know is on the sea and is much healthier than Perth although the latter is the best business place. The wages are not as good as I would like viz. £2 10s. and overtime with a promise of 5s. to be added in a few weeks. I could have got better wages if I had gone up country but I prefer staying here even at the lower wages. I think this place will suit Maggie first rate. She is going to Hugh's place for a month before she comes over here. She is going up about the end of this month. I don't expect her here before the middle of November. The sooner she is here the better.
