Parramatta N.S.W.
Sept 6th 1799.
Dear Madam,
It is with pleasure I take up my pen to inform you I received your kind letter dated Sept. 27th 1798 by the Hillsborough July 99 and also your valuable present. Accept dear Madam my most grateful acknowledgment for your kind remembrance of me not only for their being so acceptable in this dear Colony as for the pleasing idea of being still held in remembrance by so kind a friend. I regret much the loss of your present by the Lady Shore. If what Mr. Marsden had in her had come safe it would have made us very comfortable as at that time we was without any of the comforts of life such as Tea, Sugar, Wine, Spirits &c. It was very laughable to see us sit down as formerly to Balm Tea or Wheat Coffee sometimes without Sugar. Since that we have been supplied from India which at that time we had been deprived of by the loss of the Sydney Cove. The Lady Shore was a loss to many individuals,
I am happy to hear of the welfare of Mr. Edward. I am sure he must make a handsome soldier - may he prove in goodness a second Colonel Gardiner as he like him has the prayers as well as example of so amiable a mother. [20] When you write to him will you give my kind respects to him and shall always be exceeding happy to hear of his being successful. The parting with him must have been a severe trial to you. I can in some measure feel for you as I was near experiencing the loss of my dear Ann as we were going to send her home with a Mr. and Mrs. Cover one of the Missionaries that went to Otaheite and came to this Colony. Their intention was to return to England, if they had it would have been a good opportunity to have sent her. Mrs. Cover is a kind good woman, they have no children, they buried a boy about fourteen just as they left Spithead.
I own it would have been a severe trial to part with her, but the manners of the people are so corrupt and we cannot get proper servants about us, and there being not one good school that I should have been very happy to have heard of her being safe with my mother, She is now 5 1/2 years old, she reads a little and works very neat. Last Christmas we were near losing her by an intermitting fever but the Lord in answer to our prayers spared her I hope for his honor and our comfort.
My Charles is seventeen months old and that is a very entertaining as well as mischievous age. Your goodness will excuse me for saying so much of my children. You must remember I am a young mother. Mr. Marsden has wrote you a long letter and mentions every information you may wish to about ourselves and the Colony.
Mr. Johnson is much better in health than when we wrote last. Mrs. Johnson still continues to enjoy a good state of health. I am happy to have so kind a woman near me. Milbah and Henry are two fine children. Milbah you will see what progress she has made in her writing and it is a great pity she is not in England. You can have no idea what disadvantages the children labor under unless you were to pay us a visit. [21] Give my respectful compliments to Mr. Stokes and family, and
Believe me to be
With the greatest esteem
Dear Madam
Yours affecte
ELIZA MARSDEN.
We are surprised to see the alteration in the fashion. The Bonnet with white satin ribbons is much admired. Dear Madam your goodness induces me to take the liberty to say a little white ribbon would be acceptable.
