 [...] I am in good health myself only a little tired drafting sheep and weaning lambs. I believe we will be stripping wheat next week. There is plenty of bulk but the rust is on the straw of both wheat and oats. We threshed the oats when Mr. Newson was in Melboume, had the steam thresher and engine which threshed 162 bags of oats in 7 3 / 4 hours. 
We are digging new potatoes now. There is not many grown here in this part of the colony as it is too warm. Mr. Newson has done well with his wool this year. He had 52 bales which brought £730 2s.2d.... 
PS We will be here two years in six more days when we will have £40 to lift and does not know when we will be leaving. Mr. N is trying to get a girl to help in time of harvest [...]
