 [...] Well as far as I can see it is a wise step and one which I think he will not regret. He will have a better chance of getting along here once he gets a start made. He will have a better chance of getting a good screw than he would in R. and Co's. If he comes away before the winter sets in at home he will have two summers so he will have every chance to escaping cold this Christmas. 
[...] you will all have a much easier mind about James coming away than you had about us as you now know something about the place and you had very little knowledge of it then. Besides he will feel it different, having someone here before him, to what we did having, I might say, no-one. Now John and I are both in work. Then we did not know how we might fall in as to work and one of us not very able to do work of any kind. We have indeed a great deal to be thankful for. Our welfare has not consisted in abundance of riches but in the fewness of our wants which have all been liberally supplied. I hope you will all look on the brighter side of the matter. Father and mother can at least feel that they are sending a living message to their two younger sons 13,000 miles away. 
It is possible that James may have started before this reaches you so that any remarks or information I could give him would be too late. However I would advise him not to burden himself too much in bringing a lot of things but to leave room in his box for a couple of tins of good biscuits, a few pots of jam etc. which he will find very nice on board ship. If he is fortunate enough to have any money I would recommend him not to bring it on his person but send it to one of the Melbourne banks. That can be done by going to any of the Belfast banks and depositing it and then lifting it out here. I cannot tell you how to go about this banking business but he will probably know something about it himself or can get the desired information from some of the banks. [156]
No doubt one could bring a considerable sum of money about his person in safety. Still there is some risk of losing it. When one has not the money about him (but sent on by the banking company) he has not the care of it on his mind. Of course one must carry enough to meet all expenses on the journey which often runs up more than he first counts upon. It is not wise to leave oneself bare as that sort of thing would be most awkward for one could not borrow from his neighbour when he is amongst strangers. 
A soft felt or tweed hat would be the best during the entire journey. He should wear the worst suit of clothes he brings. Never mind appearances he will find many less tidy than himself on board. By the way Mary don't let him forget the sprigs of scheilleagh. I want a stick badly. 
John has not had any word about his crib on the trams yet. However he is doing garden work and can wait a while. Of course the wages will be better on the trams than he now earns. He is keeping strong and now that the winter is over he will get along nicely. 
[...] I have not made up my mind about going home to get an Irish wife yet. If I had been half up to snuff I would have had one on the triste and brought her out at any time. However what can't be cured must be endured so I had better look out for a Colonial I think; that is the only thing left me. By the way the Colonial girls are not to be despised and they are not half so scarce as you people at home think. 
I met Miss Christy of Bangor. She lives about 15 miles from here with some friends, an aunt I think. She was in the shop getting something and happened to find out who I was. We had a long chat in the course of which I could see that she lacks the polish and refinement to be found in most of the Colonial girls. However she seems to be a nice kind of young lady all the same, free in her style and manner etc. etc [...]
