Already the Defence Committee has indicated that it regards the lessons inculcated by defeat, of more value to the Unions than the victory to their opponents.
What then have we learnt? First of all the necessity for a critical inspection of weapons. In its inception Trades-unionism was merely an instrument for improving the lot of the worker within the lines of modern competition. The overthrow, of that system was no part of its business. As time has gone on, however, the commercial structure itself, within which the wheels of Unionism revolve, has been considerably modified. Monopoly has grown apace. Rings, trusts and combines have menaced Society on its purchasing side, and now Unions of employers have come into the field to cope with it in its capacity of worker and wage-earner. Still keeping in View the primary aim of Trades-unions - to get as much wealth for the worker as present conditions will admit of - we have then in the first place to consider the extent to which recent developments have left a margin within which our weapons are likely to prove effectual and in the second place the extent to which the weapons themselves demand improvement.

Now in a mere report, we must not wander into the mazes of political economy. All that it is here possible to do is to remind the Trades-unionists of Australia that they have been travelling these many years in a kind of cul de sac or blind alley, one end of which is blocked by the conditions of modern commerce and firmly cemented by the laws of the land. That is a barrier which no strike can ever break through and when we find out-selves abreast of it we shall know that Trades-unionism has fulfilled its mission, that it has carried us faithfully to the very end of the track. But we are not there yet; and in the meantime there is ample work on the old lines but slightly varied for one and all our organisations. A working day of not more than eight hours, an improvement in the wages of the more underpaid workers, the retention of those advantages gained by so many hard struggles in the past and threatened now by the united action of employers - these and many other objects come well within the original scope of Trades-unionism, and fir their achievement, in the light of the late strike, too much stress cannot be placed upon the necessity for low entrance fees to individual Unions, and of some central power to control the machinery of Unionism throughout the whole of Australia. It is impossible for independent local organisations to conduct a general strike with success. Some form of federation is imperative.
A still more important lesson, learnt in the hour of defeat is this: That whilst we must go on ever increasing our capacity for fighting as we have fought before, the time has come when Trades-unionists must use the Parliamentary machinery that has in the past used them. We are still some distance - it is impossible to say just how far - from the blind end of our industrial lane. Until we reach that end we shall still stand in need of the strike and the boycott. But the' trumpet notes, at the sound of which the barrier itself will fall, are essentially political. Once the worker determines - as he has determined - that the very basis of modern industry is antagonistic to his welfare - once he questions the right of any man to interpose a partition between himself and the fruits of his labour - he must set about the work of reform where it seems that reform can alone be obtained - and that is in Parliament. The rule that Trades Unionism must steer clear of politics was a golden rule when there was so much work to be done within our present industrial environment. But that time, as we have said before, is drawing to an end, and ere we can radically improve the lot of the worker we must secure a substantial representation in Parliament. Then, and only then, can we begin to restore to the people the land of which they have been plundered, to absorb the monopolies which society at large has helped to create, and to ensure to every man, by the opportunity of fairly remunerated labour, a share in those things that make life worth living and, above all, a reasonable chance of developing within him the qualities of perfect manhood.

The Parliamentary weapon is ready to our hand. West Sydney proved that. Too much stress cannot be laid upon its importance. Isolated labour representatives are useless - often worse than useless. The next general election must yield us the balance of power; future contests must give us an absolute majority in Parliament. Strait is the gate and sure only, but sure indeed, if we hold on our course, ignoring the touts of existing parties, knowing neither freetrade nor protection, and oblivious of sectarian differences. Self-seekers must go. Jealousies must share the fate of the prickly pear, least of all to be suffered in the home-paddock. "Politics" is a game we thust decline to play. For us Parliamentary life will be a real and perhaps a bitter warfare, at all events a life into which no man must enter who does not love the Cause before himself, who does not believe that the only statesmanship worthy of the name is that which enriches a country's toiling citizens.
This, then, is over and above all others the greatest lesson of the strike - that our organisations must become a means of education and constitutional power. Already it is half learnt. We have come out of the conflict a United Labour Party, destined and all the hypocrisy of political life to brighten the lot of our children - if not our own lot.
