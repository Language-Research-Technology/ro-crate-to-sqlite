One very good way of packing trees or plants is by putting them in tanner's bark enclosed in an iron pot or pan well closed down. Some fig and vine cuttings for the Bussells arrived here the other day in this manner and the figs had shoots on them 3 or 4 inches.
You could not send old Georgy a greater treat than some seeds, both floral and culinary - but they must all be seeds of that year's growth. In return I will send you some Australian seeds. I should last time, but Molloy had forgot where he put them.
I hope ere this you will have received some little memento per Cygnet. I send you a bunch of emu feathers given me by Mobin, a native chief - you will perceive that they are covered with a sort of red earth. This they paint themselves with and mixed with fat they extract from their food they besmear the hair which is turned up a la Grecque and confined by many strings of the oppossum hair which the women spin. [...]
The natives are very fond of all the settlers at Augusta, and we live on the most peaceful terms - but at the Swan - from the indiscretion of several persons and particularly their servants, they are hostile. The natives call Molloy King Kandarung and me Kymbin. They are delighted with Sabina and she is not the least alarmed at their black figures and rude voices. She will dance opposite the native children with great glee and an old native woman seized her by the leg the other day and embraced it without producing the slightest emotion of fear.' [...]
You are, I presume, acquainted with the existence of the Bussell family. They have lately been so unfortunate as to have their dwelling house, composed of mud and wickerwork, burnt to the ground and the property much injured by the flames. Fanny, the eldest girl, happened to be staying at the time with me. No lives were lost - but all their shoes, needles and thread destroyed, which in this far distant clime is really irreparable. [196] They have a cottage at Augusta and thither they have all repaired, bringing with them their goods and chattels - amongst which Bessie's piano - placed in my sitting room.
You may well conceive my gladness at this acquisition as I have not heard the sound of music for four years. Sabina at first was a little afraid but in an hour soon overcame it. She seemed to think it was an animal and insisted on tying a piece of cord round one of its legs hearing us speak of the legs of the Piano - She put her fingers to the opening in the front board where the silk is visible, and exclaimed, "Oh! Mama its coming out - It's coming out!" Hearing the vibrations at night when eating her supper, she said, "If the piano had a mouth Mama I could give it some sop." in time she has become fond of it & her great delight is to sit upon the music stool. She asks me to sit by her. She strikes the keys and attempts to sing - it is most ridiculous to see her - she sings, "Come a Rose, my brave Tossy Boy" (Come arouse thee, My Brave Swiss Boy), "Little BoPeep from Ingle (England) I come", "Buy a broom", and "There grows a bonnie briar bush in our Kail Yard". Yesterday morning on entering the room she asked Mrs Dawson the servant if the piano was awake yet?" I should perhaps suppress all these juvenile Details but my dear Eliza to Molloy and me they are not only amusing but instructive more especially when we rarely hear the sound of any loved voices but our own two. [...]
The Bussells always intended leaving The Adelphi, their residence up the river, but this accident has obliged them to halt at Augusta instead of going go the Vasse, where Molloy and they have taken their large grants. They are genteel nice people and that sort of thing - but terribly close fisted, which gives us the idea they belong to the Take All family, as we have on several occasions been most liberal to them yet they are not ashamed of receiving everything & you will hardly believe they have made no return - nor have Molloy or myself ever broken their bread - This must be secret - I told Mama but charged her not mention it. [...] [197]
[...] he will never leave me again unless it is to enrich ourselves and procure more comforts than we have hitherto enjoyed. True, we have drunk many dregs since we embarked on this fatal Swan River expedition, fraught with continued care and deprivations. [...]
I wish you would send Jack two pairs of List slippers to put on while dressing, and some Honey in jars. If not expensive also 20 yards of good black cotton velvet as much as would make me a very full dress and some over for children's frocks- Iname the uses I shall apply it to as I am ignorant of the width - perhaps by taking a whole piece you might obtain an abatement and I should not object to that quantity, but let it be a very good black, as you will be making up a box dear Eliza I will trouble you to get me some other things - the only impediment the reimbursement which Molloy will pay in time.
A little watering pot for Sabina and any letter book with pictures or other little bagatelle.
I am very ill off for net to use for children's caps and that if you can meet with any proper width at a cheap rate and good in kind send some also.
I wrote to Mama for Hail Oil, Pomatum and very fine tooth combs, If she has not got them enclose three combs three short large size two hair and six nail brushes very hard I had better draw out a list.
You never can do wrong in sending us out soap for which we sometimes pay 3/6 per lb. Let it be yellow or brown. Candles also and glass would materially serve us as what we do not want I could sell to great advantage.
Do make me a present of a nice new tea pot for Molloy and myself I like either biscuit ware or stone ware such as mustard pots are made of with silver rims. The one I use is a black one sine handle and half a spout. The consequence is loss of time and burnt fingers. Ask the price of a tea set of this kind if such are ever made - Its strength is its great recommendation. I mean brown looking, with raised figures.
