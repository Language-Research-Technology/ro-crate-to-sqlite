There has been a very interesting conference sitting lately in Sydney and another at Maitland (the two dioceses of this colony) and indeed the same has been going on all these colony somewhat modified - to establish a more effectual system of Church government, one suited to the more liberal views of the present age. The members of the conference are composed of the representatives, three orders, the Bishop, clergy and laity; two of the latter being appointed at public meeting in each parish; the body to meet whenever desirable to establish such laws as they may think desirable - the great point of interest that has lately been under discussion has been the framing of an Act to give the body legal authority in which there has been a very considerable difference of opinion as to whether the Bishop shall have the power of putting his veto on the decision the majority of the other two parties may come to; this point has been carried in favour of the Bishop and the Maitland conference has adopted the same views which I think is the best as I cannot conceive any good government without a supreme head though tis really a check should exist as all men are not pure in their motives. As long as the present Bishop (Barker) holds the See we are safe as he is a most excellent man but we may not always be so fortunate. Another point of great interest will be shortly decided in the Parliament i.e. the payment of the clergy. Hitherto there has been about £50,000 granted yearly to support the clergy which sum is now quite insufficient from the increase of the colony and many clergymen are supported by voluntary contributions and as the money is divided between the Episcopalians, Romans, Presbyterians and Wesleyans according to their numbers, other denominations think themselves aggrieved. The general impression is that the whole will be withdrawn as the present incumbents are removed either by death or otherwise and the whole Church be supported voluntarily and the present Government have promised to bring in a Bill to that effect next session. [37] The oldest incumbents are well paid and comfortably housed say about £500 per annum but the clergy are miserably provided for and many cases of real distress exist; therefore a change is much required. In the early days of the colony a large estate composed of the best land dispersed all over the colony was set apart for the purpose of supporting the Church and schools but as from the want of population to render it valuable it did not produce a sufficient annual income it was found necessary the Government should give a grant in lieu and it collects the rent and proceeds from the estate which is carried to the years revenue. It appears to me that this estate (which has now become [valuable?] should be again given up to its legitimate purpose but the great practical diffficulty would be in apportioning it to the different denominations. The matter will afford considerable discussion next year. Hitherto our church government has been under the control of the Archbishop of Canterbury which is found to be very inconvenient. [...]
Two months since young John Moore arrived here from Adelaide in South Australia. He has spent five years at the Victoria diggings without having accumulated any gold having worked very hard all the time. Finding he could do nothing there he went over to his cousin Charles Simeon at Adelaide in the hope of getting employment but not succeeding. Charles wrote to me begging I would give him my countenance or he would have to go to India to enter the army as a private soldier. I paid his passage up here and have given him employment on the farm at sufficient salary to clothe and keep himself respectable while he gains some farming experience, telling him it will entirely depend on the ability he shows at the end of a year what more I can do for him. I would give him a share of the income if he is capable of managing the establishment. He has grown a fine young man and I am happy to say he has come out of that temptation unscathed both in manners and principles which is very much to his credit. I cannot do more for him as I have another gentleman here a son of the late Mr. Dowling of London who is my superintendent, besides a farm overseer. I think you are aware I spent a good deal of time in [planning?] the establishment of railways in this colony and that my services were little appreciated at the time: lately they have been brought before the Parliament and a Select Committee of the House of Assembly have strongly recommended my remuneration by £1,500 which I expect to get next session: irrespective of the money this is very gratifying to me.
