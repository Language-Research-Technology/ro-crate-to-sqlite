Sydney September 7th 1832
Sir
Your well known benevolent mind and the kindness I experienced on my arrival here from England in 1820 emboldened me to hope a pardon for my present intrusion.
I believe you some months since received a Memorial from Mrs. Raine formerly Matron of the Female Factory - to several other gentleman she sent similar ones all of whom she assured me were her sincere friends and would enable her to pay the debts (trifling as she called them) then hanging over her head - impressed with this idea and having a darling boy nine years of age, my life at the age of seventy two very uncertain I was induced to marry her in March last. - I very soon discovered she was a very different woman from that which she was prior to our marriage and that so far from having gained a friend and protector for my child I had created an enemy - I also found there were heavy debts which it was not in any power to pay a part of which I need not explain as you will most probably have seen my Advertisements in the Sydney Newspapers - I am now reduced to the extreme of poverty and distress and have it in contemplation (if I am able) to get my dear boy into the Orphan School and myself into the Receptacle for the Destitute - When I left my wife which I did by Legal Advice I went accompanied by my son to a Lodging where the business of an Agent in which I was then engaged fabling off. I contracted a debt there to the amount of upwards of six pounds and not being able to pay it the Landlord not only turned us out of the house but detains our Clothes - I have since received a small pecuniary assistance from Mr. Jones (of Hunter Street) and Mr. James Foster (at Mr. Nortons) without which we must have been without food or a place to lay our heads in. - I have been twice arrested for small sums which with the blessing of God I found friendly assistance to save me from the horrors of a Gaol.
I should be intruding too far on your time by entering more at large into the distressed state in which I am now placed I will only add my humble and respectful hope that I may experience your benevolent assistance in relieving me from the present torture of poverty and distress and if it should be in your power to obtain some situation for me in your part of the Country I shall ever feel most grateful.
With ardent prayers for the health happiness and prosperity of yourself and family I remain (with the greatest respect)
Sir, Your truly distressed and obedient Servant, W.I. Speed
