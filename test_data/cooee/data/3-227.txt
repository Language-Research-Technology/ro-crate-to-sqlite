Whereas from the speedy decomposition consequent on death in this climate, it is advisable to make some provision that will admit of the early interment of bodies on which it may be necessary to hold inquests when death may have happened on a Sunday, or at such time before or under such circumstances as may have prevented the holding of an inquest on some earlier day: [227] Be it therefore enacted by His Excellency the Governor of Western Australia and its dependencies, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Council thereof: - 
1. That in every such case it shall and may be lawful for the coroner to summon, assemble, and hold an inquest on Sunday, for the purpose of viewing, examining, or dissecting the body, and thereupon such body may be interred, and the coroner may adjourn the said inquest to any subsequent day for the further investigation of the matter.

And whereas it is expedient to punish the neglect of jurors and of witnesses when duly summoned to attend on an inquest: Be it further enacted, that if any person having been duly summoned, either personally or by a written notice left at his dwelling or place of abode, as a juror or witness to give evidence upon any coroner's inquest, shall not after being openly called three times, appear and serve as such juror, or appear and give evidence on such inquest, every such coroner shall be empowered to impose such fine upon every person so making default as he shall think fit, not exceeding forty shillings; and every such coroner shall make out and sign a certificate containing the name and surname, the residence and trade or calling of every such person so making default, together with the amount of fine imposed and the cause of such fine, and shall transmit such certificate to the Registrar of the Supreme Court, and shall cause a copy of such certificate to be served upon the person so fined, by leaving it at his residence; and the said Registrar shall copy the fine or fines so certified on the roll on which all fines and forfeitures imposed at such court shall be copied, and the same shall be entreated, levied, and applied in like manner, and subject to the like powers, provisions and penalties in all respects, as if such fine or fines had been part of the fines imposed at such court: Provided always, that nothing herein contained shall be construed to affect any power now by law vested in the coroner for compelling any person to appear and give evidence before him on any inquest or other proceeding or for punishing any person for contempt of court in not so appearing and giving evidence or otherwise.
