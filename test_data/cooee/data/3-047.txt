Fremantle
January 9th 1852
Perhaps the letter that more particularly displeases you deserves more attention than all the rest but I cannot oblige people to open their eyes, happily my own mind is set at rest by having gained the object I aimed at, namely a written acknowledgement from my husband of the amount of the pecuniary obligations he was under to you which you had complained of not receiving from him, nor was that all, he was induced by me to offer you payment. I had to point out in what manner. Afterwards we were both afraid impediments might come in the way of a settlement, and then he wrote to offer to sell Grass Dale which is becoming more and more valuable and every word of that letter I dictated. All that I have to fear now is lest my endeavours to effect what is good and honorable should be turned against me by your betrayal of the private letter, a woman's weapon with which to subdue the stony nature of his impenetrable feelings. I ought not to have sent it to you but should patiently have awaited the issue in God's good time without making a human confidante. I wished you to see my struggles and that your Daughter was true come what might but surely to me is verified the truth of the vanity of human wishes. Perhaps all that I have prided myself upon in any little way or had pride in communicating to you for in that rested my pride and pleasure I shall be humbled for by your disapproval. [135] If such be the will of Heaven I will endeavour to recognize in it the chastening hand of the Almighty. Let me have one kind letter to obliterate the past.
Inadvertently I have monopolized all the sheet leaving no room for my better half at the risk of incurring your displeasure. I have previously written to acknowledge the receipt of your bounty, the package from England. I mention it again now in case that letter has not been received. I always look upon it as your gift because if you dealt strictly any fund out of our income beyond interest for the debt we owe could at all times have been applied had you chosen to paying off a little of the principal. I hope you have got the news of Mr. Brown being appointed Police Magistrate. He has been the first person to act in that capacity in the Colony. For the last year and a half of our sojourning in Western Australia an eventful period in the history of the Colony and also in our own private history it appears I have written too much. I hope you will forgive me and never mention the subject again.
I beg to be most affectionately remembered to my Sisters - nephews - neice - and the little Eliza - also that you will convey my best wishes to Mrs Bussel.
I have never heard the result of Emma's expected confinement which was reported to be near in a letter received sometime in April 1851, so you see I am rather starved for news.
My dearest Papa
Yours truly and affectionately
Eliza Brown
