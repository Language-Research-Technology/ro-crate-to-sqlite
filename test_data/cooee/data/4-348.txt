December 23rd, 1896.
Dear Sir, - My absence from the colony has alone been the cause of my failing sooner to acknowledge the receipt of the Address, transmitted by you, presented to me by the People's Federal Convention at Bathurst.
[112] You will be aware from my letter that my sympathies have been in accord with the object the Convention had in view.
I have, therefore, only to add the expression of my hope that the proceedings of the Convention, from an educational standpoint, may have a marked effect in the direction of Federation, and that such a result would be more effectually secured by publishing for information the proceedings of the Convention, and the more important speeches delivered thereat.
I am, yours very faithfully,
GERARD SMITH.
The Secretary Bathurst Convention.
