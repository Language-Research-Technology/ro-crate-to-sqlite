We have been here now close on 7 months and have had no luck as yet. When I say no luck I mean we have not made a pile but as for finding reefs we or at least I have had no trouble whatever. I found one the third day and we thought ourselves made men but Geoff wouldn't stick to it when the gold cut out and another party with more perseverance have struck it rich. It has been the same all through and I am so sick of it that I intend leaving him to pick up with someone else and I will take a job at £4 10s. 0d. per week which are the current wages up here. I can save £3 5s. 0d. or £3 10s. 0d. of that and the work is interesting and besides I would like to get a little more insight into it. I can save a little and wait a chance to join some decent party looking out for a mate [...] [92]
It is such a game of chance this reef hunting and when you find one and test it to 50 or 60 feet and it is a good strong payable reef at that depth, you have a job to dispose of it without interest among the buyers and bribing judiciously in certain quarters (chiefly the experts). Still I don't know of any better way of making a rise or a better place to do it than Western Australia miserable as it is to live in. There are thousands on these fields now and many have made enough to give them a good start in life but few have made more. It is not a bad life, plenty of excitement and risk and plenty of decent fellows always about. I never was in such a place in my life for books and papers so that a fellow has amusement as well as hard work besides always knowing how the world wags.
