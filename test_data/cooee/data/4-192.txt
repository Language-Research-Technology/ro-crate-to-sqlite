Every man 21 years of age has a vote here. There is some candidates propose extending the franchise to women but it has not become a burning question yet. However I believe it will be extended to women before another 10 years passes over the politics of this colony. You will no doubt notice the tone of self content in regard to the prosperity of this colony as compared with the other sister colonies, in the papers from time to time. There is no doubt that Victoria is in a very much better financial state than either New South Wales or South Australia. Of course our papers do not forget to trumpet it forth to its admiring readers - the Victorians or those like myself, who have adopted it as our home. There is a great deal of truth in it all for Victoria is a favoured part of the world at the present time. The advantages of all classes have here compare or rather contrast to a wonderful degree with that of poor old Ireland
