I am getting along pretty well in my new quarters [...] We have got a new hand in the grocery store Mr. Calthcart. He has been in New Zealand for a few years. He served his time in Beatie's in Ballymena where James Maxwell served his. The other drapery assistant Mr. Vance is from Magherafelt Co. Derry. Our bookkeeper Mr. Brown is a Belfast man; he has been 18 or 20 years here. The miller Mr. Grant is from Co. Armagh and the engine man his nephew Mr. Walsh is from Tyrone. [141] The senior governor Mr. Moore is from Co. Down; he is always in Melbourne. Mr. Christie is a Scotchman; he looks after the grocery and grain store. Mr. Spinks is from Dublin; he is a Presbyterian also Mr. Moore. Mr. Christie goes to Church (English) rather odd for a Scotchman. Mr. Spinks is in the drapery store so he is the man we have to look after. He is very agreeable and not too hard to put up with. 
The lady we stop with is a widow with two daughters an Irish woman from Co. Clare and an Roman Catholic. One of the daughters teaches music and she often gives us a tune in the evening which helps to pass the time. Mr. Cathcart does not board here but sometimes comes down a little while in the evening and we have a bit chat and chaff. 
Mr. Vance and I have joined the Mechanic's Institute (where we can see the newspapers every evening). There is a debating club in connection with it which holds a meeting every fortnight. All the members of the Institute who like, can debate. It is always worth hearing and one always learns something
