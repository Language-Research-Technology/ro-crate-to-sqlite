Times seem pretty bad at present all over the world. Melbourne although much better than the adjacent colonies has at present a great slackness in almost every branch of business. There have been great meetings of the unemployed these last few days. Of course all first class men get employment pretty easily but the country contains a good many who if knocked out of their usual way have not the aptitude to turn their hand to something else. Besides there are a great many good for nothing sort of folks. These folks expect to have work at as good wages as others who are worth their wages. 
Last winter the unemployed of Melbourne were given work by the government. They were quite insulted on being offered 4s. a day for breaking stones. Probably something like that will be done for them this winter. You see our government looks better after the working man than they do at home. 
As every man has a vote in this country and as our members of parliament are paid £300 a year, the members of parliament are very careful to keep the favour of the working men. You see the unemployed receive a good deal of sympathy with their fellow working people, consequently the above result
