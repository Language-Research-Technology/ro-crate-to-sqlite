Thursday 1 January
Last night the bones of Burke & Wills were deposited in their metallic coffins. The skull of Wills & feet of both had disappeared. Burke's skull a very fine one. In taking a cast of it some of the teeth dropped out which I procured. The woollen shirt of Wills still hung in tatters round his ribs. Mrs Dogherty (Burke's nurse) who had "stretched" his father & his mother, performed the last sad office for her darling, wrapping the cere-cloth round his bones & placing a little pillow beneath his skull. The room (the Royal Society's Hall) hung with black & dimly lit, with a catafalque & baldacchino in the centre, had a sombre & solemn effect. Wrote a species of requiem for performance at the Theatre Royal on the evening of the funeral. To the Exhibition of Fine Arts. The best local pictures are the "Weatherboard Falls" by E. von Guerard, a Canadian lake scene by M. Sonntag, and "Tea Trees & Creepers" by N. Chevalier, whose "Waterfall on the Parker River" has many fine points about it. But, alas for art in this colony! Guerard - the ablest, most conscientious & most industrious of the painters told me that his whole earnings last year were only £120 - less than the wages of any artisan. To the Theatre Royal in the evening - Akhurst's pantomime. Introduction very tolerable. Scenery poor. Chas Young as an oriental Dundreary excellent. Sang a clever burlesque of "Piff Paff" (Riff-Raff); the ballet girls have a clever imitation of the Maoris. Toute pensee traduite en personnages et en action, says Auguste Vacquerie, est drame, dans le sens large du mot. [378]
Friday 2 January
To the Princess's last night - "Wives as they Were", and the "Conjugal Lesson". Jefferson's drunken man is one of the best I have ever seen on any stage. The dull lack-lustre eye, the immobility of the mouth, the thickness of utterance, the limpness of limbs, the maudlin tones of the voice, the confusion of time, place & person in the memory, the dim sense of humour lighting up the foggy condition of his mind generally, the vague motion of the hands & the imbecile good humour of the man, are points of detail, each of which challenges a separate tribute of admiration. One special merit of Jefferson's acting is that he is absorbed in & by the character he sustains for the time being. To quote a favourite expression of his own, he never "travels out of the picture". He appears to be unconscious of the presence of an audience, & therefore never plays at them, When he is not taking an active part in the business of a scene, he fixes his eyes on those who are speaking, and does not endeavour to divert attention from them, or to defraud them of their legitimate applause, by the introduction of impertinent bye-play. In addition to which, he is scrupulous in "giving the stage" to the principals in the dialogue.
Wednesday 21 January
Public funeral of Burke & Wills. All business suspended. The procession about a mile in length, started from the Hall of the Royal Society, passing through Spring Street, Bourke St & Elizabeth Street to the new Cemetery. The footpaths lined with spectators, who also clustered on the housetops, on the awnings, at the windows, on cars, coaches, carriages & wagons, & wherever a view of the cortege could be obtained. From all the suburbs of Melbourne, & from the country districts people had been pouring in all the morning, & I should compute the number of persons who witnessed the imposing spectacle at not less than one hundred thousand. I rode in the same mourning coach with Bourke's [sic] foster mother, Mrs Dogherty, & the survivor of the Expedition, John King. In the evening, at a crowded meeting in St George's Hall, the Governor presented the addresses I had written, to Ambrose Kyte, Commander Norman & Alfred Howitt. Dr Macadam made a successful speech vindicatory of the Committee. He was denied a hearing at first; but eventually carried the audience completely with him, & was congratulated by the Governor, the Chief Justice & the Bishop in having rehabilitated the reputation of the body to which he had acted as Hon. Secretary. At the Theatre Royal, a Musical Ode on the death of Burke & Wills, written by myself, & admirably set to music by Mr Reiff was sung by the company in mourning, Madame Lucy Escott, Miss Hodson, Mr Squires & Mr Wharton taking the solos. [379] It was followed up by a tawdry tableau vivant, which had been better omitted. At the Haymarket, Richard Younge declaimed a Monody written by Dr Bowman, illustrated by tableaux vivants.
Thursday 29 January
A complete fiasco at the Theatre Royal. A young lady named Young whose appearance had been heralded by mysteriously worded puffs, made her debut as Amina, in "Sonnambula". Her voice was painfully thin, her execution tolerable, her action awkward, her stature short, & the experiment an utter failure. The house was crowded in every part, & at the end of the First Act, there was such a manifestation of displeasure as a Melbourne audience rarely indulges in. At length the Manager came forward & made an apologetic conciliatory speech, in which he stated that the young lady was an Australian (Farquharson says she was born in London) that he was induced to give her an appearance by the recommendation of some gentlemen who heard her at rehearsal, and concluded by soliciting a hearing for her in the next Act. This was accorded, but from what I heard in the course of ten minutes, it was apparent that her presentation to the public was a ludicrous mistake.
Thursday 5 February
Placed the correspondence in Aspinall's hands. To Lyndhurst in the evening to dine with Barden. The other guests consisted of Messrs Sasse, Duigan, Teale & Labertouche. After dinner our conversation happened to turn upon the sensual extravagancies of Martley (Solicitor General in a former Administration, who is married to a charming woman - a niece of Chas. Lever's). On one occasion Martley is said to have been found dancing, naked, in a brothel, surrounded by prostitutes. On another he gave the wretched inmate of one of those houses, situated in a right of way off Bourke Street, a cheque, which was dishonoured. The women of the house took away his clothes, & he was a prisoner for two or three days, until a brother barrister sent him a suit & released him. Someone observing that such a man ought to be castrated, Duigan said that he knew a lady (née Kate Featherstone) who, having detected her husband, a Major in the army, in an act of infidelity, actually excised his penis with a razor, from which he nearly lost his life. Sasse said that while he was residing at Montpellier a similar circumstance came to his knowledge. In this case a young girl had been seduced by & lived with a young man, to whom she became passionately attached. [380] But on the eve of his marriage with another woman, his former paramour induced him to sleep with her & she performed the same horrible operation with the same weapon. After having thus mutilated him, she announced her willingness to marry him. He took her at word, & she became a most devoted wife.
Sunday 15 February
Dined at O'Shanassy's with H.W. [W.H.] Archer, Hugh Glass, P. Higgins, Quinlan, Julian Woods, Father Finn etc. Discussed the project of an Australian Quarterly Review, drawing its contributors from the whole of the Colonies in this group, circulating among all & endeavouring to build up a sound & healthy public opinion to discuss problems of political & social science with breadth and vigour, and to serve as a bond of union among the first class literary & scientific men in Australia. Woods, Archer & I offered to give our services for a year. Conversation turning on the approaching visit of Prince Alfred, the foundation of an Australian kingdom, with Prince Alfred as its sovereign was debated. O'S strongly in favour of monarchical institutions; observing that our future choice lay between them & petty ephemeral republics. We were rich enough & populous enough to constitute an independent kingdom, and the creation of a Court & aristocracy, surrounded with the elegancies of civilised life would have the effect of rendering the colonies more attractive both to those who are already here & to those we are desirous of alluring hither. The only difficulty anticipated was the agreement of the other colonies, seeing that Melbourne from its position & other circumstances would naturally claim to be the capital of the kingdom, and the seat of the Court & Legislature.
Tuesday 17 February
Aspinall tells me that the brothels of this city are under a police surveillance not altogether dissimilar to that which is practised in Paris. They are classified and those in which the visitors are liable to be robbed are carefully discriminated from those which are conducted on "respectable" principles. In some cases the prostitutes are serviceable as thief-takers, giving information to the police when notorious bushrangers & others pay them a visit. Captain Standish - my informant adds - is furnished with a report every morning of the number & the names of those who have spent the night in the better class of brothels. The record must be a curious one and calculated to lift the veil from the secret immoralities of many of the outwardly moral & respectable. [381] [...]
Tuesday 21 April
Parliament re-assembled. Duffy mentioned a smart repartee of Mr Moore one of the Irish members in the Imperial Parliament, who, referring to the dissensions among his own countrymen, quoted the current saying that if one Irishman was being roasted alive, you would always find another to turn the spit. An Opposition Irish member interrupted him by some inaudible ejaculation; whereupon he exclaimed "What was that? I didn't catch the remark of the honorable turnspit." The House roared. Another anecdote of Archbishop Whately who, at the time the Whigs were filling all the offices in Ireland with Catholics, was consulted by the Lord Lieutenant as to the most fitting man to appoint to a vacant bishopric. "Couldn't you find a respectable Caro-tholic?" was the sarcastic query of the Protestant prelate.
Introduced to Deniehy, of Sydney, one of the ugliest men I ever saw, short of stature, slovenly in attire, with unkempt hair, a fluffy moustache, small eyes obliquely set, very near his nose, & generally half close, & eyebrows rising diagonally from the root of his nose. Altogether his countenance resembled that of a withered monkey. Completed "Duke's Motto" and handed Fifth Act over to Kyte.
Tuesday 19 May
Festivities in honour of the marriage of the Prince of Wales to the Princess Alexandra of Denmark. A steady rain until 2 p.m. when it cleared up until midnight. The city and suburbs gay with garlands, triumphal arches, flags, banners and greenery. At night a brilliant illumination, the streets thronged with spectators, & the general effect impressive if not imposing. Transparencies innumerable were exhibited, & tons of Chinese crackers must have been exploded. In the Chinese quarter, in Little Bourke Street, so incessant was the discharge that it resembled a sustained fire of musketry, & was accompanied by the beating of gongs, tom-toms, & all sorts of discordant instruments. From the roof of the Library, the coup d'oeil was magnificent. All Melbourne & its belt of suburbs, was visible. Bonfires were kindled on Mount Macedon, the You Yangs, Plenty Ranges, and at other points on the horizon, & showers of rockets were sent up from the Botanical Reserve. Coloured fires were burnt on the roof of the Melbourne Club, the Bank of Australasia & other elevated sites two huge As flamed in front of the University a gigantic cross of light sparkled in front of St Patrick's & St Francis's Cathedrals; & a huge cresset blazed at the unfinished tower of the former. [382] Looking down Bourke St the sight was very animated. The yellow light gleamed upon a dense mass of upturned faces, reaching from Spring Street to Queen Street, and through the midst of the crowd slowly wound a serpentine line of carriages, each with its pair of lamps, & looking, in the mass, like a monstrous snake with luminous scales. In most of the suburbs, oxen were roasted whole, & barrels of beer set flowing; while the poor and the inmates of the charitable institutions were universally regaled.
Thursday 28 May
Governor's Ball at the Exhibition Building
Frazer MLA got very drunk & on the way home quarreled [sic] with a cabman, who called in the police. He abused these as being either orangemen or papists, O'Shanassy's spies or Standish's pets. Eventually he was taken to the watch house, but was liberated on his own recognisances. About daybreak, accompanied by Dr Macadam, he knocked up the Mayor (E. Cohen) and entreated him to take the charge off the charge sheet. Upon the Mayor refusing to adopt such an illegal course, Frazer shed maudlin tears of penitence, wiped his greasy face with a skull cap (which he pulled out of his pocket instead of a hand kerchief) and presented a most ludicrously woebegone appearance; being half sober, and wholly dirty and demoralised in appearance. What makes his escapade the more amusing is that he is Chairman of a Legislative Committee, now sitting, to inquire into & report upon the organisation, discipline & management of the Police Force.
Friday 14 August
Kyle related to me an episode of colonial life. Some weeks ago a young lady called at his office to enquire if he had any rooms to let in Bourke Street, suitable for opening a school. Interested by the applicant he questioned her pretty closely & found that she possessed good testimonials; that she had been a governess in Sydney, where she was engaged to be married to a respectable young man, who died of disease of the heart a few days before the time appointed for their wedding. Her health & spirits having been shattered by this shock, she was recommended to come round to Melbourne, where she had formerly lived & where she hoped to obtain an engagement as a governess. Disappointed in this expectation, she was induced to apply to Mr Kyle, who having satisfied himself of the truth of her story, told her to call at his office for a weekly stipend, until she could obtain employment. [383] A month afterwards, when confidence had been established between them, she told her benefactor that when she first called upon him she was penniless, had pawned all her spare articles of clothing, had been turned out of doors by her landlady, & had been without food for two days. She had therefore determined on committing suicide, but some vague impulse had induced her to apply to him. "What a glorious thing money is!" said Kyte repeating the incident to me. "I never felt so proud & thankful as when I found out that I had stept in between that poor creature and destruction."
Wednesday 21 October
To Guerard's in the evening. Good story of a Mr Horden who was the first to take cattle overland to Adelaide. Being looked upon as a great gun, he was invited to Government House, but was so much immersed in the business objects of his journey, that when Governor Gawler, at dinner, happened to inquire "What will you take, Mr Horden?' he replied, "Fourteen-ten a head all round & the calves thrown in."
Wednesday 11 November
The Governor declines to give his patronage to a performance at the Theatre Royal, for the benefit of the Benevolent Asylum, because Barry Sullivan is opposing Chas Kean, who, as the protégée of the Duke of Newcastle, Secretary of State for the Colonies, is necessarily an object of interest to a colonial governor.
After the first night of the Keans' appearance at the Haymarket, when the audience was neither excessive in number, nor immoderate in its enthusiasm, Mrs Kean observed to Coppin: - "If I were Ellen Tree, I would play once more, to complete the education of the people, & return to England forthwith."
Thursday 12 November
Gave some readings from Copperfield to about 4.00 prisoners at Pentridge. I felt that I never read so well or succeeded more completely in carrying the audience with me. It was interesting to watch the effect of the pathetic passage descriptive of Mrs Copperfield's funeral on that congregation of felons. The most profound silence reigned - broken only by the "sniffing" of the attentive listeners. Numbers dropped their heads, & were touched with a sympathetic grief, & at the end there was a general blowing of noses & clearing of throats. The humorous passages they appeared to enjoy hugely. [384]
Wednesday 16 December
After three days heavy & incessant rain, we experienced a devastating flood. The Yarra rose 37 ft 6 in above its ordinary level & all was ruin & consternation on its banks. Houses were swept away, trees uprooted & crops washed out of the earth. The rise was so sudden & so incredible that numbers of persons living on the banks of the river were unable to save their furniture. In my garden the water nearly reached the edge of the flower beds about two hundred feet distant from the ordinary banks. A wide waste of water swept from the Custom House to the sea & boats traversed the interval. Emerald Hill rose like an island from the flood. Traffic on the Hobson's Bay Railway was suspended & communication with St Kilda cut off, except by a circuitous route. Numbers of small farmers in the rich valley of Heidelberg were ruined by the calamity; & market gardeners, brick makers & felmongers on the banks of the Yarra suffered severely by the inundation.

AN IMPRESSIONIST EXHIBITION 1889
Such an exhibition of impressionist memoranda as will be open today at Buxton's Art Gallery, by Messrs Roberts, Conder, Streeton, and others fails to justify itself. It has no adequate raison d'être. It is as if a dramatist should give a performance on the stage of such scraps of dialogue, hints of character, ideas for incidents, and suggestions of situations as had occurred to him while pondering over the construction of a play, or as if a musician should invite people to listen to crude and disconnected scraps of composition, containing the vaguely indicated themes for a cantata, a symphony, or an opera; or as if a sculptor should ask us to inspect certain masses of marble from which he had just blocked out the amorphous outlines of various pieces of statuary. None of these is to be regarded as a work of art. Neither is a painter's "impression". It is simply a record in colour of some fugitive effect which he sees, or professes to see, in nature. But, like primeval chaos, "it is without form and void". To the executant it seems spontaneous and forcible. To the spectator it appears grotesque and meaningless. The earliest impressionist of whom we have any knowledge was Piero di Cosimo, and he had "a bee in his bonnet". Vasari tells us that "he would sometimes stand beside a wall against which various impurities were cast, and from these he would image forth the most singular scenes, combats of horses, strangely ordered cities, and the most extraordinary landscapes that ever were seen". The modern impressionist asks you to see pictures in splashes of colour, in slap-dash brush work, and in sleight-of-hand methods of execution leading to the proposition of pictorial conundrums, which would baffle solution if there were no label or catalogue. [385] In an exhibition of paintings you naturally look for pictures; instead of which the impressionist presents you with a varied assortment of palettes. Of the 180 exhibits catalogued on the present occasion, something like four-fifths are a pain to the eye. Some of them look like faded pictures seen through several mediums of thick gauze; others suggest that a paint-pot has been accidentally upset over a panel nine inches by five; others resemble the first essays of a small boy, who has just been apprenticed to a house-painter; whilst not a few are as distressing as the incoherent images which float through the mind of a dyspeptic dreamer. Here is an impression, for example, entitled "Harrowing", which is quite true to its title. It represents a long-legged pig in company with two terribly deformed horses - or are they "creatures of the slime?' - struggling to get away from one of those scarecrows, which English farmers set up in their cornfields when the grain is ripening, and dislocating their legs - number uncertain - in the process. And here is a mystery, called '"The Milky Way", consisting of two or three spots of positive colours on what appears to be a sheet of smoked brown paper. Here, again, is something bearing the title of "Orange Blue and White representing a hydrocephalus doll with glass eyes, wooden hands and a broken nose, almost buried in a mass of white-lead. And there are landscapes and samples of architecture belonging to some embryotic world in which as Pandulph says All form is formless order orderless and nature herself is either unshapen or misshapen. Some of the impressions, in which sufficient work has been put to entitle them to be spoken of as sketches show that the artists are capable of much better things Such is the clever "Looking over to Williamstown" of Mr R. E. Falls; the "Fisherman's Bend", "Evening in Richmond Paddock", and "Austral Summer", of Mr A. Streeton; the "Treasury", "Early and Damp", "Good-bye", and "Going down to Dinner", of Mr Tom Roberts; the "Dear Lady Disdain" and "Myosotis", of Mr Charles Conder, and the plastic sketches of Mr C.D. Richardson. These and a few others afford something agreeable for the eye to rest upon; but the exhibition, viewed as a whole, would leave a very painful feeling behind it, and cause one to despond with respect to the future of art in this colony, did we not believe with Mr W P Frith R A that Impression is a craze of such ephemeral character as to be unworthy of serious attention."
