Parramatta
April 27th 1803.
Dear Madam
I once more sit down to drop you a line. As we are at all times exceeding glad to hear from you it may give you the same pleasure to hear from this part of the world. Last Easter Sunday I consecrated my church at Parramatta. This building proves a great comfort to my mind as I can now perform a divine service in a manner becoming the worship of Almighty God. At Sydney there is no place for public worship and I fear will be none for a long time to come. I do my duty with great reluctance there and few attend for want of accommodation. It is surely one of the most shameful neglects of Government that perhaps was ever known since we became a nation professing Godliness.
Government have granted one of the Roman priests who was sent a prisoner from Ireland permission to perform the Catholic service here. I am apprehensive this toleration will be productive of some serious evils. [31] Satan has still his friends in the world and maintains his cause in every quarter. I did not expect to see his kingdom strengthened among us by the addition of the Roman religion. God is all wise and he governs & orders all things according to his own will. I cannot but lament the evils I have not power to prevent, It has been with many years labor and patience I have got a temple erected. It has also been built in troublesome times and had many to oppose it. Sometimes I contested against those who opposed my church and sometimes I craved their aid. At length I have had the honor and happiness to dedicate it to the worship of God and shall retain a grateful sense of his goodness in opening the way to have it completed so far. I am surprised no Clergyman comes out in the place of my former Colleague Mr. Johnson. He tells me he has no inclination to visit us again and that none has been appointed to succeed him. The political state of the Colony is much changed since my friends departure. The measures adopted by the Government have made very many poor who were lately in better' circumstances. I have no cause myself to complain. God has blessed me in my Basket in my Store. I may say he has given me all things richly to enjoy.
1 labor' hard but the toils of the day makes rest sweet at night so that the morning finds me ready for my task. My spirits and strength seldom fail me. I should be happy in a colleague as I am constrained to travel from Sydney to Parramatta every Sabbath which is 16 miles and preach in both places. Another clergyman would ease me in this respect and some others.
I am making great progress in my Orchard and Garden. I have got many hundred of different Fruit Trees and great abundance of some kinds of fruit. I made more than 60 Gallons of Cider this year which promises to be very good. This was made from peaches, though we have apples they are not of the cider kind. I have hops also growing now well. The vines have run more than two feet. A man of the name of John Fleming is gone to England in the "Glatton." He is an uncommon clever man as a gardener & botanist. Should he call upon you he will give you a better idea than any person you have seen of this Colony. [32] [33] He was a prisoner here but an honester man cannot perhaps he found in England. I have requested him to make a small collection for me of such things as he knows I want. Should he return to this colony I should wish him to call upon you and then he will learn what kind of seeds & plants you would wish to have. Mrs. Marsden and my little family are well. She returns thanks for all favors and joins me in the kindest respects to Mr. Stokes and yourself.
I remain
Dear Madam
With the greatest respect
Yours SAML Marsden
