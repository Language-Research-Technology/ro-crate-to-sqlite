The best rifle to use here is the ordinary Snider, a sporting Snider (1,000 yards) by Hollis to take a 577 boxer ammunition is the best rifle for kangaroos. [87]
A Martini is very good but too long to carry on horse back in the bush and it drives the bullet so quick that it does them no harm unless it hits a bone whereas the boxer 577 which is hollow fronted turns inside out when it hits anything and the wound bleeds freely. I was surprised to see the damage it does. A Snider gets leaded very fast and for accurate shooting must be sponged well every third shot [...] 
I am glad to hear about the business doing so well and that £100 is a veritable Godsend. It will start me. I would not advise you to come here till I look around a bit. You see you and I are totally different. I am only fit for roughing it and take delight in so doing. Some rough fellows some days ago were trying to disgust me by eating the grubs out of the black boys but I at once asked for one and it really went fine. For nearly a week I was camped with some niggers and they having taken a fancy to me gave me a grand corroberie a thing few of the colonials have seen. 
I would not advise you to come here on mere spec. You no doubt would get a situation in Perth and be one of the first in the place on account of your education. If you can see young Stewart's father he might write to his son who is aide-de- camp to the Governor in Perth (Claud Stewart). He could do a lot for you. You can be sure of a living anyhow. 
I expect to be with the surveyors soon. I have not earned a penny only on an odd boomer skin. As for being a burden to the Wright's I work very hard for them as Geoff is so lazy and Mr. Wright is too old for work so Frank and I do the most of it. Geoff can shoot, ride and reap and this is all. Frank who owns the stock and land is a hard worker and very decent. He is making £3 a week shooting at kangaroos but he uses two horses a day. I tried but could not manage on foot. They are much tamer when you are mounted with a bell on the horse. He has made £3 a day with his bullocks hauling timber at the saw mills. Geoff was too proud to do such work but goes shooting and then never gives his parents anything and never bought any stock. I have persuaded him to apply with me for a job with the surveyors but he only wrote today. Elyjah and Harry are in comfort but have to work hard. 
When I got here I could not sleep; the house is full of bugs. It is made of split mahogany slabs and mud and has 4 rooms. 
Christmas was spent shooting, a sweepstake and athletic sports and then we danced till daylight. I can dance a bit colonial still. The girls here are a fine lot and can work like horses. I don't see why you put Mr. on my letters. Excuse dirt as I have been out with the rifle.
