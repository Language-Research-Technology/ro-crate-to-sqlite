Ah! Lil my darling little wiffie I wish I could hear these magical words my Alick my own from your own dear lips, that would be happiness indeed. I am afraid my wiffie has been a little downhearted when writing to me or you would not think of melancholy things as the future without me. Why my darling I dare not think of the future without you in it. It would give the blues for a month. Oh Lil the very thought of such a thing being possible makes me shudder. As for you bearing it if I were single, I think if you did not marry me and married anyone else I think if ever I met him I would kill him. I would go mad, the idea of another man clasping you my darling loved one in his arms would drive me really mad, the thought of it now makes the blood rush to my face. Lillie I could not bear it. If I could not get you myself I could not let anyone else. It is selfish but I could not help it. I do not feel wounded but I think you must have been in a despondent state and I would not like my little girl to be downhearted, it does not make much matter about me as I am alone but my Lillie must keep a brave heart for she knows her Alick loves her and her alone and those about would feel to see my little one sad. Yes I do love you far better than anyone else in the world and with you alone is bound up my life's happiness.
