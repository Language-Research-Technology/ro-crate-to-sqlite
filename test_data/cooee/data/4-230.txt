You will be surprised to know that Sarah applied for a block of land (700 acres) adjoining mine which she has been recommended for but awaiting the approval of the Minister of Lands. I have paid my survey fees making our lease and first half year's rent in all £20 £1s. 10d. for 742 acres of which I can select 320 acres and then keep the remainder in leasehold. Sarah's is leasehold but I can get somebody to dummy it and get 320 of Sarah's to put along with mine and make 640 which will be useful some day. I believe it will be good interest for our money as we can either let it or sell it.
