I would have replied long before this to your circular of date 27th July last, but waited expecting to find my journal, which was lent to Miss Drysdale and cannot be found, which will account for the meagre reply I now make.
1. In September 1835 I shipped per Norval, Capt. Coltish, the first cattle for Port Phillip.
2. In March 1836 I landed at Melbourne with my family. There being no constituted authority, I was requested to act as a general arbitrator. I did so by common consent, my tent being the police office. Many felt a pride in showing an example in upholding order, which was done without much trouble. The people were very quiet and attended every Sunday morning at my tent for public worship, where I read the Church of England service.
3. In April 1836 I built, by subscription, a house for a church and school - the old weatherboard lately removed from St. James's. [131]
4. The first clergyman who visited us was the Rev. Jos. Orton, Wesleyan, and afterwards the Revs. Messrs. Clow, Forbes, Grylls, and Waterfield.
5. In May 1836 Mr. Batman arrived with his family.
6. From that time we had weekly arrivals with stock from Van Diernen's Land, and many stations were taken up near Melbourne.
7. In July 1836 we took the first census, numbering 149.
8. In December 1836, the first herd of cattle was brought from Sydney by Mr. Jno. Gardiner and Capt. Hepburn.
GEELONG.
9. In May 1836 I landed my sheep at Point Henry, and occupied the present township of Geelong as a sheep station, and Indented Head as a cattle station for Capt. Swanston. Messrs. Cowie and Stead and myself had the whole Western district to ourselves for eighteen months, parties being all afraid of the blacks. We were afterwards joined by Roadknight, Darke, Derwent Company, Russell, Anderson, Brown, Read, McLeod, Steiglitz, Sutherland, Murray, Morris, Lloyd, Ware, Learmonth, Armytage, Raven, Pettett, Francis, Bates, and others.
10. In 1837 I built the present house of Kardinia, which I called after the aboriginal word for "sunrise." I built also a house for the Derwent Company, occupied afterwards by Mr. Fisher.
11. In 1838 Mr. Strachan built the first store in Geelong; he was followed by Messrs. Rucker and Champion.
ABORIGINES.
12. On my first journeys into the country I was very much surprised to find so few natives, and thought they were keeping out of the way. During our first visit to Buninyong we did not see one, and on our first journey to the west, when we discovered Colac and Korangamite, we saw about twenty at Pirron Yalloak, who fled on seeing us. [132] On better acquaintance I found their number really very small. All within 100 miles had visited us.
13. In December 1836 I was at great pains to muster all that were in the Geelong district, and gave each a blanket; they were Buckley's tribe, and he assured me I had mustered the whole of them, amounting to only 279. They were always friendly; I was well known amongst them, and wherever I went they received me kindly. But, alas! the decrease has been fearful, chiefly from drinking, and exposure to all weathers bringing on pulmonary complaints. Since their connexion with the whites there has been little increase. When I first numbered them they had several children amongst them, but they decreased every year, and now in this tribe we have only 34 adults, and only two children under five years. The men now living were all children when I arrived, and are beginning to look old, so that in ten years more there will not be one alive.
Every attempt to civilize them has signally failed. I have had several in my family for years, and taught them to read and go to church with the family; but after a time the other youths would threaten them and carry them off, when they again got fond of a savage life. I am convinced that no plan, except one based on entire isolation, will succeed with these poor degraded people.
Addenda. - The Marrack (scrubby) Hills near Cape Otway form fifty miles by ten of dense scrub, exactly like the country you saw at Wilson's Promontory, with immense trees towering to the height of 80 and 120 feet, and fern trees of 20 feet in the gullies, a rich black soil, and streams of water running into the sea every six or seven miles.
