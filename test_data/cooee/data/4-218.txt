[...] trade is not very brisk in Sandhurst at present. However he is getting a very fair share. It is satisfactory to note that his takings are steadily increasing week by week. James expects a hard fight with the other hardware people but he intends sticking to them and get the best of them if possible and I believe he will succeed. 
I had a letter from John about a fortnight ago. He expects to get the fence finished that will enclose a total of about 350 acres about the middle of July. He has let the grass of it to a neighbour for 12 months when we hope to get a little cash together to put on some stock. It takes a lot of money to put up so much fencing. On account of James starting business he cannot help now with the money matters for the farm so it makes it all the stiffer for John and myself. However little by little we hope to get things into working order bye and bye.
