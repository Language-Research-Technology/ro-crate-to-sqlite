THE POINT AT ISSUE
We want to clearly understand, all of us, the point now at issue in the industrial struggle which convulses the entire eastern and southern seaboards of Australia, the whole coast of New Zealand, and the great coal-producing centres of Newcastle, Illawarra, and Lithgow. Everybody should understand that it is no longer a question of the affiliation or non-affiliation of marine officers with other labour bodies, but a question of the very existence of those union principles upon which every union in the world is based and builds. In retaliation for the Jondaryan affair, wherein the maritime men successfully maintained for their bush brothers the right to organise and to have their organisation recognised by the pastoralists, the shipping companies are endeavouring to shatter the very structure of the maritime unions. When we realise riot only that behind the shipping companies stand the federated employers unions but the pastoralists are making good the losses sustained by the shipping companies in the battle, we must see that the attack upon the maritime unions is 'only a prelude to concerted attack upon every union of weight and importance throughout Australia and throughout the civilised world. [427] In fact, we have already been warned that the squatters propose to attack the Queensland Labourers' Union next year and that the London dock companies propose locking out the Union dockers directly the bitter English winter sets in, and that the British Ship-owners' Federation is trying to pick a quarrel with the British Seamen's Union. Throughout the English speaking world there is a wild effort being put forth by Capitalism to force labour once more into the hopeless servitude from which Unionism alone redeems it.
Unreasoning and unreasonable, Capitalism refuses even to discuss the points at issue unless the whole citadel of unionism is first razed to the ground by the unconditional acceptation of a 'free labour' basis. Capitalism desires an agreement that henceforth no unionist will refuse to work with a blackleg or on blackleg goods, that henceforth the miners will hew coals for non-union ships and the maritime men handle indiscriminately non-union and union wool, that shearers will not fight for labourers or wharf labourers for seamen, and that the bricklayer shall work unquestioningly on bricks over which his brickmaking mates are fighting a fight that stirs him to the heart; Capitalism insists on the recognition of a so-called 'free labour' status, which means that the necessities and weaknesses of men are to be taken advantage of to prevent any union ever again getting into fighting trim, that by hook or crook, force of fear or fraud, enough non-unionists are to be kept in every occupation to render the workers powerless to resist the oppression of Capitalism. Capitalism refuses to confer on these points; it will not meet Labour in conference to hear Labour's contention and to know that the rival statements will go forth side by side into the world; it insists that any conference held shall be a sham and that unionism shall beforehand be made a farce; and then it prates through the capitalistic organs of the tyranny of unionism and the danger to liberty of the dominance of the labour federation. [428]
It is well to compare the attitude which the Organisation of Labour has always assumed on the conference question with the attitude of employer associations. Before the Brisbane printers' strike a conference was asked for by the old Trades and Labour Council of the Master Printers' Association and refused; before the recent Brisbane bootmakers' strike a conference was requested by the Brisbane District Council and only agreed to after the strike' had begun; almost invariably labour unions have attempted to settle disputes by conference even though they felt themselves strong enough to force their demands without and very usually employer-unions have either openly derided the very idea of meeting wage-earners on an equality or shuffled out of an open discussion which would place them publicly in the wrong. The Melbourne Trades Council attempted to secure a conference at the commencement of this strike, Mr. Service intervening, and for weeks the united effort of the allied unions through the Intercolonial Labour Congress has been to secure a fair and open meeting, whereby the public could impartially judge of the merits of the case which judgment would end in a mutually satisfactory settlement; Capitalism so far shuffles and refuses. And yet unionism is charged with tyranny in the face of the fact that at the shipping office conference which settled the Jondaryan trouble the contention of the labour delegates was so reasonable and moderate that the chairman, the Hon. E. B. Forrest, himself a representative capitalist, emphatically stated that he considered it should be admitted by the squatters' delegates. At Jondaryan, the Australian Labour Federation and its allies throughout Australasia practically had Capitalism by the throat and could have dictated for the time being unconditional terms, yet all that Capitalism was asked to do was to come to an open conference and treat on an equality with the unions which the Darling Downs squatters had resolved to ignore.
It is very evident that for this peaceful victory of Jondaryan, for this first unmistakable indication of the federation of Australasian workers and of the determination of men of all trades and callings to recognise the Unity of Labour and that an injury to one is the concern of all, Capitalism has never forgiven its organising employes. [429] It has recognised, what We all recognise, that if the workers only stand together in a mass the end is certain, that if we hold each other as brothers always and fight each others' battles as our, own and close up the ranks in impenetrable solidity there is no doubt who will win in the great Labour movement which shakes the world today. It recognises, too, what is the truth, that so long as our inner unionism remains unbroken victory or defeat matter but little, that always the constant lesson of unity is being taught and always the ceaseless drill of organisation goes on. And so it seems that in order to secure its weakening grip upon the toiling masses, who slave for its profit and live only that it may enjoy, it must not only prevent one union from assisting another but break down the stronghold of unionism itself by forcing upon us, a 'free labour' agreement. This, is the point at issue now. The marine officers' affiliation question only hastened the grappling of Capitalism with the New Unionism and has been thrust entirely out of sight by the new point which Capitalism has raised.
It goes without saying that upon this point unionism can never, unconditionally yield. It is a point which must be fought to the bitter end with all the patience and courage of men who see that on it there is a universal consensus of Labour thought. For this the maritime men stood ready to down tools at Jondaryan, for this they downed tools rather than work with blackleg officers, for this the southern miners have ceased to hew coal and for. this the gold of sympathetic unions is being poured ungrudgingly into the strike-pay coffers. So long as there is a shadow of a chance of success the unions must, perforce fight on unflinchingly for this great and necessary principle - combination and recognition. And at the very worst, if without competent crews, without skilled waterside labour, without the usual supply of coal, Capitalism still holds to its preposterous demands, it would be better and nobler for the unions to go down together and rise together when with the return of good times Labour is in fair demand and unionism is able to renew the fight. This we all know: that such a basis as the employers are offering could not be held to, that if the unions agreed to it they would perjure themselves, for at the first opportunity they would be compelled by irresistible conditions to defend themselves in the union way. [430]
And things being as they are, what can we think of the present situation but as widening still wider the gulf that separates employer and employed, Capitalism and Labour? Capitalism will not budge one inch towards Conciliation, which it is not forced to budge; Capitalism will not yield a single inch to Labour which it is not forced to yield; Capitalism which has protested against being dubbed 'enemy' by the labour organisations shows itself indeed an enemy, bitter and ruthless. And it does so because it cannot help itself, because the conditions of our industrial system are stronger than men's intentions and because the spirit of that system is'a cruel and brutal and abominable competitionism, the taking advantage of one another's weakness. The Labour movement aims at the changing of those conditions by the reforming of the industrial system, a movement which tends steadily through the limiting by unionism of competition among the wage-earners to the securing to all, by state cooperation, of that opportunity to work without which the right to work and live is null and void. All these labour strikes and capitalistic lockouts and industrial upheavals come because a few capitalists own the chief means of production, and because the wage-earners have no place in industry but as mere adjuncts by whose ill-paid assistance wealth is produced for the profit of Capitalism alone. What we want is a co-operative system of industry, controlled by a community in which all would be workers, conducted not for profit but for use, sharing to each worker justly and fairly, and not, as Capitalism does at present, taking advantage of the worker's necessities to squeeze him down to a mere subsistence wage and giving no, heed to the unemployed who wander outcast in the midst of our wondrous wealth and boasted civilisation. To get such a co-operation we must maintain unionism intact or we shall be forced to a condition so degrading that the wage-earner will be unable to assist himself to carry on the agitation which must precede reform, we must encourage and foster that loyalty to each other without which co-operation is impossible, and we must resist at all hazards the frantic efforts of Capitalism to rivet more firmly on our necks the fetters from which we are freeing ourselves. [431] And this we must recollect above all things, that it is our duty to keep the Labour movement free from unjust doings and mere seffish considerations; that in it are bound up the hopes of all who suffer and weep and mourn because of man's inhumanity to man; and that what we fight for is not only the trifling gains of the immediate present but the expansion of unionism as we have it to-day into one great industrial Brotherhood, in which employer and employed shall join hands, employer and employed no longer, and from which, because all, work together, want and destitudon, vice and crime and poverty, shall be banished for ever and ever.
