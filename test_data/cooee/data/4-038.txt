Having unsaddled and tethered our horses in one of the gullies on some coarse grass, we entered the overseer's hut, the interior of which was scarcely an improvement on its outward appearance. It consisted of three rooms, one of which was a store, in which were kept the flour, tea, sugar, meat-cask, &c., of the establishment; another was the bedroom of the overseer's female servant; whilst the principal apartment did duty as kitchen, dining room, and overseer's bedroom, and was arranged in this way : - On one side, and close to the fireplace, stood a rough bedstead, an opossum-rug spread over, which concealed the bed-clothes beneath. [275] In the centre of the room there was a large sea-chest, which served as a table; and at the fireplace, which occupied the whole of one end of the building, and was almost as large as one of the smaller rooms, the supper was being cooked - to the no small increase of a heat already excessive. Against the walls, around which were hung a pair or two of horse-hobbles, a gun, stock-whip, some tin dishes, pannikins, a rickety looking-glass, and other odds and ends appertaining to the gentle craft of squatting, were set three rough stools; and on the mantelpiece were disposed, evidently with some regard to effect, a couple of Hall's powder canisters, of a flaming red colour; a horse's hoof; some blue paper boxes containing seidlitz powders (the overseer's substitute for sodawater); a meerschaum pipe, with a large glass-stoppered druggist's bottle as a centre-piece, containing some three pints of a sherry-coloured liquid, and labelled butyr of antimony. In one of the walls of the hut there was an aperture of about a foot square, cut through the slabs as a window, before which was drawn, on strings, a little curtain of white calico. The outer door, which always stood open by day, was secured at night by a bar; and a couple of wool-packs, nailed to the tie-beams and reaching the ground, supplied the place of doors to the two smaller apartments.
On arriving, we had been met by the overseer, who ushered us into the hut, and formally put me in possession of the premises, with the air of one who was relinquishing what he evidently looked on as a very complete little establishment. Of the correctness of his views on this subject it hardly needed the smile, which I thought I detected on the faces of my friends, to remind me that some diversity of opinion might exist. There was a momentary lull as we sat down, and the eyes of each wandered involuntarily over the hut, and took stock of its contents. It was clean in its way, but very comfortless as I thought then; later on I got used to things still rougher. After a moment, the friend who accompanied me broke the silence, remarking, as he turned towards me - "The hut is well enough, though rather small; I assure you we don't think this bad in the bush."
"As tight as a nut, sir," said the overseer, interposing and looking up at the ridge-pole, evidently pleased. "I had it new barked in the spring. You'll find everything very comfortable and dry," continued he, addressing me. "A grand thing, sir, a dry hut; a grand thing! My old one at Western Port used to leak like a sieve, and we were always wet. But, I dare say, gentlemen, you are hungry after your ride." And, turning to the servant, he ordered supper. [276]
In due time the sea-chest table was covered with a clean towel; three willow-pattern plates, in more or less dilapidated plight, were placed on it; an old pint pannikin, partially filled with clay and topped up with mutton fat from the frying-pan, with a bit of old shirt wrapped round a stick stuck in the centre for a wick, did duty as a lamp; some odd knives and forks made their appearance from the store-room, whilst a round wooden box (marvellously like a lather box) supplied the place of a salt-cellar. Beside each plate the servant laid a pint tin pannikin and a slice of damper; and a large tin dish was placed in the centre of the table. Everything was clean at least, and the tinware bright as silver. After these preliminary steps had been taken, some rather coarse brown sugar was put in the pannikins, which were then filled with tea from an iron kettle which was simmering by the fire, and finally a leg of mutton was transferred on the end of a large iron skewer, amidst clouds of vapour, from the iron pot in which it was boiling, to the tin dish on the table, the overseer at this stage of the proceedings inviting us cordially to "sit in" and have supper whilst it was hot. It certainly was hot, and so were we, - and no danger of us, at least, getting cool. The atmosphere of the room, the fire, the vapour, the odour of the "fat lamp", the scalding hot tea and reeking mutton, were neither pleasant nor inviting; but as there was no preferable alternative, we did "sit in" to the edge of the sea-chest on our three-legged stools, and, setting to work manfully, acquitted ourselves as well as could have been expected of novices under the circumstances. "Messieurs, vous étes servis!" said one of my friends, laughing, as we began our meal; probably some hotel on the Boulevards suggesting itself to his mind as a contrast!
