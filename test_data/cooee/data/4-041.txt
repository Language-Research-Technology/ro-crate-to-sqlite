Of the gentlemen one saw, a good sprinkling were squatters, who had brought their flocks and herds from New South Wales or Tasmania. As a variety of the genus homo they were distinguishable by their hirsute appearance; whiskers, beards, and moustaches being decidedly in the ascendant among them. Many of them, I noticed, indulged in blue serge shirts in lieu of coats, cabbage-tree hats, belts supporting leather tobacco-pouches, and in some few cases a pistol, which, with breeches, boots, and spurs, completed the costume. [287] The horse, too, seemed an animal all but inseparable from the young gentlemen I am attempting to describe, who, if not engaged in chatting in twos and threes at the corners of streets, or in the act of coming out of or going into one of the inns, might generally be observed hurrying on horseback from one end of the little town to the other, occasionally, to avoid detours, taking their nags over one of the gutter chasms which intersected the streets. One young squatter, I remember, was particularly noticeable, as it was his custom to have a black boy in livery mounted on his horse's croup. Nor did such little eccentricities seem to surprise the residents or attract much notice, the accepted idea seeming to be, that bushmen were not by any means amenable to the slow ways of the dwellers in towns, and that many things were proper enough in them which might have been esteemed strange, or even objectionable, in others.
The squatters of that period - generally new arrivals from home, and young men who had brought with them more cash than experience - were a good deal discussed by the townsfolk, and more especially by the ladies, who, it struck me, had vague and curious notions concerning them. As far as I could gather, the prevailing notion seemed to be that the squatters' habitat in all cases was some fearfully remote and lonely locality which it would be quite impossible for ordinary persons to reach; that without his horse the squatter could not exist; that he wore habitually Hessian boots and spurs, of which it was uncertain whether he ever divested himself; that he was much given to emu and kangaroo hunting; had constant encounters with hordes of blacks; rode as a rule fifty miles a day, chiefly at a gallop - a performance which seemed as necessary to his horse as to himself - and at night slept anywhere, with his saddle for a pillow. It was also surmised that some sense, peculiar to the young squatter, enabled him to find his way in the most unerring manner through trackless forests and waterless wastes; that (when out of town) he lived solely on tea, mutton, and damper, and enjoyed, when in the saddle, a perfect immunity from fatigue. All this of course was mere surmise; what townspeople really did know about the squatter was, that in town he was lavish in his expenditure, affected tandem driving, had a decided penchant for beer and brandy, smoked continually, and was not as a rule over-punctual in his payments, or versed in the ways of merchants or bankers. His peculiarities, however, real or imaginary, did not survive the very early days of the colony; he was too lively a bird for our forests, so that eventually, lawyers and courts of justice put out many a shining light of those times. In the early days the young men took to the bush and the neighing steed, as naturally as they now become bank clerks, lawyers, and cricketers.
