In the obituary of September, brought us by the Malta, is the honoured name of Leigh Hunt. He died at Putney on the 28th August, 1859, in the 75th year of his age. Forty years ago, Shelley addressed him from Rome, in the dedication of The Cenci, "One more gentle, innocent, honourable, and brave - one of more exalted toleration for all who do and think evil, and yet himself more free from evil; one who knows better how to receive and how to confer a benefit, though he must ever confer more than he can receive; one of simpler and, in the highest sense of the word, of purer life and manners, I never knew: and I had already been fortunate in friendships when your name was added to the list." Loftier tribute of respect has rarely been paid, or sincerer - for the man was never born that Shelley would have flattered. How precious this truth of character in a world where our friends tell as many lies to please as our enemies to pain us! [157]
Leigh Hunt's nature was of the most graceful and beautiful kind, fresh, resilient, and flowering to the last. Like the shepherd boy in Sir Philip Sydney's Arcadia, he piped as if he never would grow old. His mission seemed, as Spenser said of the presence of Una, to make sunshine in the shady places of the earth. There was too much boyish goodness and sweetness in him to sympathise very heartily with the fiercer struggles of men. At his heart was for ever the whispering consciousness that things might be better brought about by that power of gentleness of which he has sung with a grace more delicate than the graces of the Sicilian muse he so loved. He was right, if men would only look upon the thing as the loving poet did. But, meanwhile, Leigh Hunt had philosophy as well as pleasure on his side. "Nothing," says Goethe "is an illusion that makes us happy." No truer heart than Hunt's, and no more courageous intellect in the cause of right and what he held to be truth, will you find in the history of our modern literature. His faith in good, his unquenchable hope, his charity, tender and boundless, made his writings a fountain and an oasis in an era, "when Zahara, under the breath of the most lone simoon," was thought a type of the higher ideal; and this will make them lovely and a solace for ever. 
He had his own sorrows and his struggles ; and his circumstances in life were always dim and sorry enough, - now a poor man tossing with his family in Italy, trying to throw up a shelter under the somewhat bleak and gloomy ranges of Lord Byron's friendship, - now in late age flying into such raptures, as seen in Royalty after its decided liking for the Legend of Florence at the theatre, something like an embodiment of all human virtues conceivable. We allude to this, because we see or think we see in it the pathos of an overflow of gratitude from one who had grown old in comparative neglect. It "Flattered to tears that aged man and poor." [158]
Yet no shade of uncharity or moodiness or hate in his poetry the while. There the precious elements of his noble genius, its sweet airs, its sunbeams and its dews, the bloom and the fragrance of a nature more like Chaucer's or Boccacio's than any in modern times, were gathered as his contribution in aid of the cause of human happiness, which he looked upon literature as altogether created to serve. 
He was the Stothard of poetry. The region of grace, deepening ever and anon into beauty, was the haunt and vantage-ground of his genius. His poems were sensuous, but with a spontaneous, perfectly organic growth out of his own nature, which neither the sensuousness of the great living poet, Tennyson, nor Mr. Dobell's, nor that of any of the laureate's other disciples, possesses. Art is with them often conscious, and has to seek. The thing was in Leigh Hunt part of his temperament; the weakling tendril as much as the rich bough grew out of and belonged to Mother Earth. He was deficient in passion; and this disqualified him not only for dramatic art, but, combined with the sunny hilarity of his nature, made the depths of tragic strife and tragic woe distasteful to him. He shows in his preface to the "Stories from the Italian Poets" - one of those charming critical prefaces which Leigh Hunt alone could write, alike fitted for schoolboy and sage, from the transparency of expression and simple directness of thought - the superiority in Shakespeare to Dante, because of the large element of human gladness. We suspect, that even if Shakespeare had been inferior to the "sad Florentine" in essential poetic power, Leigh Hunt, on the one ground that the former had admitted more of the light of human gaiety and cheerfulness into his world, would have preferred him. The grim images of the Dolorous City were not a whit less in unison with his natural tastes than "the dark sorrows of the line of Thebes." But this scarcely ever impaired his fine critical instinct. He devotes pages to an attack on the sort of taste and feeling exhibited in the mediaeval theology of the Inferno, for reasons which would make the Paradise Lost only a degree or two less objectionable. [159]
But Carlyle himself, with all his worship of power, has said nothing finer of the intensity of Dante. A single passage will give one who has never read the Divina Commedia, either in Italian or English, a livelier, more concrete idea of the general characteristics of the poet than a volume of tolerably good criticism:- "The invisible is at the back of the visible; darkness becomes palpable, silence describes a character, nay, forms the most striking part of a story; a word acts as a flash of lightning, which displays some gloomy neighbourhood, where a tower is standing, with dreadful faces at the window; or, where at your feet, full of eternal voices, one abyss is beheld dropping out of another, in the lurid light of torment." And the ineffable majesty and beauty of Dante's angels, and the Elysian interspaces of repose in the poem, are described with almost equal felicity. He was the kindest and most genial, as well as one of the best of critics. He came disposed to find merit, high or humble, much or little, in the work before him. He had a word of praise - so wise and so gentle it was! - for the poor daisy that grew beside the field-stile, as well as for the most gorgeous blooms. Look through the whole range of his miscellaneous writings, from the days of the Indicator upwards, and you will find no one harsh, much less an arbitrary, phrase of criticism. A blow at cant he aimed whenever he could, but, his nature always overflowing with truth, in nine cases out of ten, when the blow fell the canter was dead and gone. A collection of Leigh Hunt's criticisms inclusive, as well of his special essays on books, and of the notices scattered throughout his numerous publications, as of such comparatively brief observations as occur in his notes and prefaces, would make one of the most fascinating books in the language. The Legend of Florence was his dramatic effort. It is very graceful, full of purity, gentleness, tenderness, pity. The husband is a wretch; the lover much to be sympathised with; the lady a sweet and noble creature to love and be sad for. But it is not a great drama. To compose one, there was, as we have just said, too little sympathy or self-identification in Leigh Hunt with the grandeurs of passion, the magnificent warfare of the daring spirit with circumstances. [160]
He thought - far overmuch - this world too beautiful and too good, ever to be a great dramatic poet in any sense, much less, a tragic poet. The "burthen and the mystery" pressed on him too lightly, his spiritual being had struck no root deep enough in the Unseen, where the solutions wait. It is perfectly impossible under any circumstances to conceive Leigh Hunt creating such grand types of the struggle as Robert Browning's Djabal, or Luria, or King Victor, or Richard Horne's Cosmo de Medici, or his lordly Marlowe. 
Bright is the day, the air with glory teems,
And eagles wanton in the smile of Jove:
Can these things be, and Marlowe live no more?
Circumstances long prevented Leigh Hunt's recognition as a poet, which show how much tact might have done in the world of letters, as it does in lower and coarser regions. He was saluted by the scribblers of the day as the Coryphaeus of the Cockney School. Keats, as his protégé, of course belonged to it; Hazlitt was sometimes ranked on the forms (as by Maginn in his parody on Yarrow Unvisited); and so was John Hamilton Reynolds, whose promise never gave fruition. So might have been Hood. Now if there were any internal weakness in the school, any affectations at all, Barry Cornwall, in his earlier and longer efforts, exhibited them in common with Hunt and his friends. But he had never written sonnets about Hampstead and the other pleasant environs of London. "He sang of Africa and golden joys;" he took himself, in fact, to Sicily, and 
"The shores of old romance."
And if Hunt had consented to burn a great many occasional verses, written under suburban inspirations, he might have saved himself much annoyance. His beautiful story of Rimini, in its own history, affords a proof of how little ground, as regarded Hunt's poems, there was, either in philosophy or fact, for the cry of Cockneyism; how little a man of genius requires, the culture of "travel" to enable him to write fine poetry of which the scene happens to be laid in foreign lands: Rimini, with its landscapes, the wood of Ravenna included, was published before Leigh Hunt had visited Italy, and the beauty of scenic description sank into the soul of every reader of sensibility, to remain there for ever. After the poet had beheld the actual places, he altered the scenery, treated the thing photographically, but with so deep and pursuing a sequence of failure, that late in life, in the last editions of his poems, the original landscapes were restored as the "environments" of Francesca and her lover. [161]
How the beautiful episodes of Rimini live in the memory, - the nuptials, the journey through the pine forests, the garden, and the funeral of the lovers at the close of autumn, with the last few leaves flying over the chill, darkening road, and the crowd awaiting till the sad cortège made its appearance, when 
Turned aside both young and old,
And in thin hands, the gushing sorrow rolled! 
But the poem of the Nymphs, so full of "the warm South," and the sonnets in the volume called "Foliage," long out of print, appear to us most to exhibit the spécialité as a poet of Leigh Hunt. Of his prose writings - his romances of real life, his charming revivals of classic story, copies as it were by Fiamingo and Canova of the women and children on a Greek frieze, and his exquisite essays, forming in themselves the freshest and sunniest nook in the great literature of the day which saw them produced, - we have now no time to speak. They will never be read by a man fitted to appreciate the grace and the affection for all good that inspire them without a love for the author simultaneous with admiration for his work. 
In that grave of Leigh Hunt sleeps as true a friend of humankind as ever drew the breath of life. An earnest, we trust, of the loving admiration which awaits on his memory wherever the language and the literature of the land is known, is the poor offering we have tried to hang up, as it were, in funeral honour, - the tribute of one born and bred in a community which had scarcely existence at all in the days when Leigh Hunt began the noble labour of his life long years ago.
