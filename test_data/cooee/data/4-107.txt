A great many people were disappointed in me. They thought that because the other fellow cleared that I would be disheartened and throw the thing up and that I could not manage them without him. However it happened that I held on to my purpose and the bees have done better under my own separate care than when he was with me. There is a man in Kew who was talking to me today. He was very anxious for me to join partnership with him next year but no more partnerships for John. 
[...] You will be surprised to know that Oscar Amey departed this life on the 20th at the Alfred Hospital Melbourne (South) he died of typhoid fever and congestion of the lungs. Linch (Kitchen's gardner) Fraser and I undertook to bury him in Kew cemetery in a private grave, the deeds of which will be sent home to his father. It will cost me about £1. He was buried on Tuesday last.
