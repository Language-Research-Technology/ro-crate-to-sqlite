I am going to look at some land 20 miles from here as soon as I get maps down from Perth so that I can make a home for myself and I think Louis couldn't do a better thing in the event of my getting suitable blocks than join me. I can keep him with me all right and he can take up some land when he comes of age as he has a few pounds then and would have half the increase of my stock while helping me and I could help with the rough work in return for his work while with me. I really believe he would do better that way than in New Zealand where he will sink to the level of a labouring man as I nearly did here but have since risen a bit socially and don't ever mean to work for wages down here again. 
I want to get away from Wright's if I can and make a home for myself [...] I am getting to know some very nice people round about and frequently stay away for a few days which breaks the monotony a bit. It is so nice to hear a piano again. You wouldn't believe how I enjoyed it. A branch of the Edgerton Warburton's are among the earliest settlers here and have kept themselves very select. However I am admitted into the charmed circle and I can tell you I am glad to see a little refinement after so much roughness.
