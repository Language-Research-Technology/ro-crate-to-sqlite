PORT JACKSON.
Gentlemen, - 
I beg you will make known to the public, and those connected with the vessel mentioned below, the following circumstance.
The ship MANGLES under command arrived under Murray's in Torres Straits on the evening of 18th Sept, 1835, on the morning of 19th, several Canoes came alongside with shells, etc, to trade, in one was a white person apparently an. European quite naked as the Savages The greater part of the natives came on the Starboard quarter, the quarter boats being lowered half down for the purpose of Trade.
I remained some time on the Starboard quarter, watching their movements till several had gone ashore I then went to the Larboard side to enquire respecting the person whom I had seen, he then had dropped a little astern, and from enquiry.
I found he was an Englishman, wrecked some twelve months since in the Sir CHARLES EATON, in Torres Straits, and wished much to come on board, but the Natives would not allow him, at the report of this, I manned and armed the Cutter and sent the second officer, Boatswain and six men to take him at any price, stationing myself on the poop with armed men to protect them in the event of any objection to his being given up.
They hooked the Canoe with a boat Hook and told him they were come for him, his reply was "take that Man, he will go with you," pointing to a Savage before him.
"Not" said the second officer "I am come for you and you I will have."
He immediately threw down the paddle he had in his hand and dashed under the Midship of the Canoe out of sight; I then ordered my Boat to return and said, "if he prefers a life with Savages to being with me, he may remain," and the boat was hoisted up again. Subsequently the fourth officer told me he had said there were eight men on shore detained by the Natives, and what his motive could be for not coming into my Boat I am at a loss to conceive, as he might have stepped into her. [169]
However not feeling altogether satisfied, I manned and armed the Boat again and went myself in her close to the Beach with my Spy Glass, remaining there two hours. The Natives were very anxious for me to land; but, seeing so many on the beach and many more behind the Bamboo work and a large Canoe ready for launching, I did not think it proper to do so. They brought a little European boy (apparently 2 or 3 years old) down close to the Boat, but would not allow me to touch him. I also saw a Boat building under cover of a shed by European hands I am certain, but could not see a white man.
After I returned on board, I watched with my glass the remainder of the day but still saw none, and remained all night at anchor, thinking it might be possible for some of them to make their escape; but, seeing nothing of them the next morning, at nine I weighed anchor and came away through the Straits and anchored under Booby Island in the morning of 21st, and there got letters under a Memo, of H.M.S. HYACINTH having been there on 8th with a convoy from Sydney, all well, the MARQUIS OF HUNTLEY, MORRISON, and Brig CHILDREN.
I left Hobart Town 31st August. That there are Europeans on Murray's Island I have not the slightest doubt, and that they are detained there by force; or why not come to me. The one that was alongside I could not see again. I arrived at Timor, Co pang Bay, October 1st, and found the Captn. and Crew of the JANE AND HENRY there, arrived the day before in the launch, wrecked on the Barrier Reef. I conveyed them to Sourabaya.
There was such a ship as the SIR CHARLES EATON I know, but who are her Owners I know not; that this should be made known to the proper Authorities, for a Man-of-War to relieve them, there is no question about. I have written to the Commander-in-Chief on the East India station.
I am, Gentlemen,
Your most obedient servant,
W. CARR.
Commander Ship MANGLES
