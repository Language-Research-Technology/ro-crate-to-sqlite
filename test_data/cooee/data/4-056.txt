Do you know we laugh at your ideas of the native language, there being no words tenses etc. Why Alick, how do you know they haven't? You know very little of their language, they have one of their own is certain, for see how they will talk to one another quite volubly. It's because you know so little of their language you cannot make them understand you, now isn't it? I hope you have not had much trouble with the natives lately. I do hate to hear of any hostility between them and you, to me it seems dreadful to fire at them, and the poor prisoners that are sent to Bathurst, they have a fearful time of it from what has been coming to light lately, poor miserable degraded wretches. The whites will have a deal to be answerable for someday I fear, so called Christians. Oh my darling keep yourself free from any stain of these poor creatures, I know how very annoying the attacks on the sheep must be but we should strive to do unto others as we would have them do to us'.
