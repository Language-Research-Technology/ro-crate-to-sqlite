Hr. Justice Holroyd, Victoria.
East St. Kilda,
Nov. 10th, 1896.
Sir, - 
I have to thank you for your letter of 26th of October, which, however, reached me only a few days ago, notifying that a Convention will be held during this month at Bathurst, under the auspices of the Federation League of that city, for the purpose of discussing the principles and details of Federalism as an aid to the education of the people. Although unable to take part in your proceedings I can assure you that your undertaking has my hearty sympathy.
Towards establishing a permanent basis of union between the several Australasian colonies nothing, it seems to me, could more effectively conduce than knowledge, generally diffused, concerning the experiences of other, and especially kindred nations, which have already adopted a Federal system. Yet how few persons comparatively have made themselves intimately acquainted with the constitution of the United States and its practical working, or with the history even of the Dominion of Canada. The bulk of the population, whose intelligent adherence should be the mainstay of Australian Union are, I fear, very ill-informed on such subjects. I shall rejoice, if, as an outcome of your discussions, a series of pamphlets, written by impartial and competent students, were extensively circulated throughout the colonies, explaining and comparing the two most modern systems of Federation, and pointing out the lessons which their history affords for us. Facts are what the people want; facts over which they can think, without any political prejudice, before they are called upon to act. 
I have the honor to remain, Sir, Your very obedient Servant, 
E. D. HOLROYD. 
Thos. A. Machattie, Esq., President Bathurst Federation League.
