William again asked my opinion regarding his coming out here as he is frightened to risk another winter on the breadcarts. You can see by the already mentioned that we have got cold weather here as well as at home but the atmosphere is much clearer. I would rather not give any advice to William further than what I have done as there is a second party interested in the matter viz. Sarah and that is my reason for not advising him for or against. If I did it would simply be a repetition of what I have already told him in a former letter. If he came out here or any other person they have to run the risk of getting a situation to suit them. Some are very fortunate and others are not, but a man or woman that is willing to take a turn at anything for a time has never any reason to cry want. Although times are dull here at present, yet there is always work for a man with a willing mind. But men of capital have a better chance here than a man that is depending on his work graft. 
I believe if we had enough money to give us a start in a store up country that we could do well yet I have no reason to grumble and I may here mention that I don't regret coming out as regards money matters. Of course the mind often wanders back to the old home and home has always its tighes.
