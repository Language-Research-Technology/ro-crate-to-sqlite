You ask in the letter to John what kind of men my employers are. Well one is an Irish man from Newry and the other an English man. Craig the Irishman mostly attends to office affairs. It was he engaged me and indeed engages all the hands, of course with the other's opinion on the matter. He is liked better by most of the hands that I have heard expressing an opinion. The other is a whimsical old fellow and as some of the hands say, you don't know when you have or when you haven't him; is rather hard to please at times and sometimes get through a good many strange hands. There has been many come and left since I went there. I often think of turning to the farming, when bothered or annoyed about something or other but dearie knows I might turn farmer along with John some time; hard to say what's before us.
