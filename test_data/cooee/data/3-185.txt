TO THE DUKE OF NEWCASTLE
Government House, Brisbane: February 6, 1860
My Lord Duke,
It has long been known that a large proportion of the animal and vegetable productions of Australia is distinguished by characteristics directly the reverse of what is familiar in Europe. It would almost appear that an anomaly of similar nature exists in the influences exercised at the antipodes by certain political institutions.
I find that it is a very general opinion among competent authorities that vote by ballot and manhood suffrage, as compared with open voting and a low property qualification, are in this community, institutions of a conservative character, and calculated to give increased influence to the landed proprietors and rich settlers in the country districts, as opposed to the mixed population of the towns.
In Australia, aristocratic influence cannot be said to exist, but the ballot protects the voter against the occasional violence and dictation of democratic opinion. Again, energy and industry, with the prosperity consequent on those qualities, are so common among the Australian settlers, that in the towns and villages of Queensland there is hardly a working man who does not possess at least the property qualification required by the New South Wales Constitution Act of 1853. In fact, the majority of our labouring classes live in their own houses, built on their own land. In the towns and villages therefore, manhood suffrage may almost be said to have practically existed before it was formally enacted (with slight modifications) by the Electoral Law of 1858.
If a general view be taken of the important question now under consideration, it will appear that vote by ballot and manhood suffrage are not likely to lead, in this Colony, to those dangers and inconveniences which have been apprehended from similar institutions in older, more thickly-peopled, and less universally prosperous communities.
In the first place, distress and pauperism, those comprehensive terms so frequently used in European politics, are unknown in Queensland. All classes of this community appear to be thoroughly imbued with the love of law and order, and the other virtues which naturally grow up with the acquisition of property, however small, and with the enjoyment of that prosperity which is the legitimate reward of honourable industry.
Again, in an Australian Colony there exist none of those classes and institutions to which vote by ballot and manhood suffrage are supposed to be antagonistic. Here there are no paid idlers or sinecurists; every man, from the Governor downwards, is emphatically a working man. Nor have we a Church establishment, a House of Lords, Lords, or hereditary privileges of any kind to which democratic sentiments and prejudices are hostile. [390]
But in this colony there is a numerous class of shepherds, stockmen, and agricultural labourers settled on the pastoral stations of the interior. Though equally trustworthy and prosperous, in most cases, with their fellow workmen in the towns, these men were excluded from the electoral roll by the provision of the Constitution Act of 1853, because they are regarded, in some degree, as hired servants living in houses belonging to their employers. They acquired the franchise by the introduction, in 1858, of the principle of manhood suffrage, and are stated to have usually exercised their new privileges, when well treated by their employers, as those employers recommended. This class of men are now again disfranchised in consequence of the construction put upon the Order in Council of June 6, 1859, by Sir William Denison's legal advisers, and many of our great pastoral settlers ('squatters') consider that they have thereby lost a large amount of political influence.
The most important consideration of all yet remains to be stated. In several British dependencies, in the Ionian Islands, in parts of British India, and elsewhere, the full concession of political power to the people would have the unfortunate effect of arming alien and disaffected races against British supremacy. But next to an enlightened and reasonable attachment to the principles of local self-government, in analogy to the usage of the British constitution, the strongest political feelings of the overwhelming majority of the population of Queensland - let me say, of all the Australian Colonies are undoubtedly at the present moment loyalty to the person of the Queen and pride in the mother-country. Speaking of Queensland in particular, I might say that the feelings to which I allude almost approach, in a large proportion of the inhabitants of this Colony, to that maladie du pays, that passionate love of England, which an acute writer of extensive colonial experience (Mr. Gibbon Wakefield) foretold thirty years ago would be the result of allowing the Australian Colonies to manage in their own way their own internal affairs. As Lord John Russell wrote in 1855, the avowed desire of the Australian colonists to assimilate their institutions its far as possible to those of the parent country is in itself a proof that their sympathy with that country is not merely the expression of a common sentiment arising from a common origin, but is connected with a deliberate attachment to the ancient laws of the community from which their own has sprung.
