West Maitland Feby. 18th. 1863 
Dear Father 
I have taken a notion of writing a few lines to you Hoping you will excuse me for not writing to you for the last six months or more. I have nothing particular to tell you now - but I have been Dreaming of you of late very often and very nasty Dreams. I hope there is nothing wrong with ye with the blessing of God. My wife has been Dreaming of her people also so we were thinking there might be someting wrong with ye. 
The reason I did not write or answer your late letter was my wife was very bad for a long time with a deadly Headache. She Tried all the Docters in this district but done her but little Good. She had to go to another Town about 40 miles from Maitland to a more noted Docter. He done her some good but she could not stop away from the children under his care for anny length of time. How ever she is a good deal better and after she was over the worst of it one of the children took a disease called the Gastic fever which Continued on her for 4 months but thank God she is getting all right although she was given up for death by this Most Eminent Docter in this part of the Coloney. He is newly come to this Town his name is Docter Doyle. He charges (£1) one pound a visit besides medcine. His Bill soon amounts to Something. Though he is an Irishman he has no compassion for rich or poor he must get his money. 
My Dear Father I hope every thing is geting on all right with you. I am very thankful to Mr James Shannon for his Kindness to me for scending me the newspapers. They gave me great pleasure to read them and many more besides. I do scend you & Mr. Shannon a paper every month. If you receive them they will give you more news than I could concerning many things. The mail Steemer leaves here 22nd. of each month and the mail arrives here about the 10th or 12th of every month. 
We had a very dry Season nothing but scorching hot weather for 6 or 7 months no grass no water except in the river and some places the river was not within 20 miles of them. Thousands of sheep & cattle died for the want of water or feed. They dont Care much for that here especily in the bush. The Town people feels it more for it made the Beef & Mutton Dear. [92]
They could not travel with cattle from the country without water so beef is 4d per lb. I will scend the paper it will show you the market price. Potatoes are 12 shilling for Cwt. in the Town. They cant be had up the country for love or money. They are sowing the second crop of potatoes now. We are after 3 days and 3 nights rain which fell in torents the same as a cascade. 
I got a letter of late from Mich Carrigg & family they are doing very well. I am in the same Employment as yet. I have nothing particular to tell you at presant. Patt Neylan & family are well. My wife want to know how is her Father Mother Brother & Sister are geting on. Remember me to all my uncles aunts & relations likewise my old neighbours. Let me know as much as you can about home. I should like to hear does Austin Nester write home or not. Thomas Doolan did not write to me of late I think he left Sydney. Remember to Mr. J Shannon and Martin Neylon & wife not forgeting my uncle Ned. 
I conclude these few lines by giving my best respects to my Stepmother Brothers & Sisters & to you my loving Father. I had always a notion that I would see you but alas I dont think I will be able. But I give you my Blessing 
Michl. Normile
