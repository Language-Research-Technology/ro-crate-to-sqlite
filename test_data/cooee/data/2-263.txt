We are able to enjoy ourselves very pleasantly in our domestic circle. What with music, singing, and now and then a little dancing of an evening, we have very little reason to complain of the loneliness of the bush or to sigh for the gaiety and amusements of the city. A short time ago we had what very much reminded me of years ago at home, that was a tea-party something like what we used to have at the book meetings at Plaistow; there were about twenty of us altogether. As, however, we had no books to discuss after tea, we substituted music, singing and dancing, interspersed with games. and tricks, and what was equally important, quite an elegant supper, got up under the joint superintendence of Mrs. Eager and Caroline.
