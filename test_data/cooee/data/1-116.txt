Sydney, Saturday, 5 o'clock.
MY DEAREST LOVE,
I have been deeply engaged all this day in contending for the liberties of this unhappy colony, and I am happy to say I have succeeded beyond what I expected. t am too much exhausted to attempt giving you particulars; therefore I must refer you to Edward who knows enough to give you a general idea of what has been done. The tyrant is now, no doubt, gnashing his teeth with vexation at his overthrow. May he often have cause to do the like.
