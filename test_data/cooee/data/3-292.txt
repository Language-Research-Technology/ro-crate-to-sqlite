Camp on the Oakover, lat. 21° 9',
December 13, 1873.
DEAR Mr. Elder, - We are all alive, and that is all. We have lost everything, and have only two camels left out of seventeen. Our journey has been difficult beyond all I had supposed possible. We are reduced to such a state by famine that we can scarcely crawl 100 yards, and are quite incapable of hard work, or indeed any work at all.
I send two men with two camels to try to get some help from the station on the Do Grey, and this goes by them. I cannot now give you details, not knowing who your agents in Perth are. I have written to the Governor of Western Australia to take steps through your agent to send a small craft to take us to Perth. This is the only way we can get there. We are unable to go by land. It would require an entire new fit out, and would cost much.
I may safely say no exploring party ever endured such protracted suffering as we have done, nor did any one ever cross, with their lives, so vast an extent of continuous bad country. A man gets great credit for exploring such a country as we are now in: it is mere child's play; whilst we unfortunates, I suppose, shall be called fools for fighting for months against misfortunes and difficulties which have turned back others in two or three days. [301]
I hope to be able, when in Adelaide, to satisfy you that I have done all that could be done to get across. We have succeeded, and that is one consolation, but our lives have been saved only by the mercy and goodness of God. Our own arm could not help us out of the shadow of death that has fallen darkly upon us on several occasions.
"We are gaunt pictures of suffering, and have nothing but the few rags we stand up in.
The monsoon may delay me.
I shall of course hasten to Adelaide.
Ever yours faithfully,
P. EGERTON WARBURTON.
The Hon. T. ELDER, M.L.C., Adelaide."
