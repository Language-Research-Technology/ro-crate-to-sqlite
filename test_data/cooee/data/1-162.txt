Parramatta
March 27th 1817.
My very dear Madam
This will be delivered to you by a pious young man who is coming to England with the intention of entering into Holy orders as soon as he can obtain the requisite literary qualifications. I hope he will stand in my place and preserve the holy seed in this distant land. I consider him a little like young Timothy and I hope he will be an honor and a blessing to the Church of Christ.
Your long looked for box arrived by the Lieut Governor to the no small joy of all my girls. The day was too short for them to examine your presents and to point out all the beauties of the Dolls & dresses.[65] [66] I shall pay particular attention to your request respecting the Minerals and have sent to the Derwent to see what can be found there.
As I advance in years I am involved in greater difficulties, it will be no small portion of the happiness of the Saints to be where the wicked cease from troubling. I have had harder to contend than ever lately and never passed thro' so much anxiety in a given time at any former period of my life. I must prevail in the end though the struggle is very painful.
Should you see my friend Mr. Good he will explain more fully my situation. Unconverted men in power roar like lions at the sound of the Gospel. They shew their enmity in every possible way. Every King of Babylon has his Golden Image and whosoever will not fall down & worship his god must be cast into the burning fiery furnace. I now move slowly like a loaded wagon pressed beneath the sheaves of wheat. Fighting's without and fears within attend me. They that live godly in Christ Jesus must .suffer persecutions This will hold good in all countries and particularly in this. Some Ministers are bold in preaching the Gospel in the pulpit but out of it they are very careful what they say or do lest they should give offence to the ungodly - I see such men but I cannot approve of their plans.
I have lately in some heavy storms stood alone and the storm is not over yet. From a wicked world I expect no favor, no peace. The Mission to New Zealand has also added much to my anxiety. All things have gone on there as well as I could have expected as far as concerns the natives but the pecuniary concerns have been distressing to me. They have far exceeded what I had reason to expect from various causes. I wish I was free from these or at least that my Colleagues would enter heartily into the work to assist me. I find it too heavy a responsibility for me.
I am in hopes now that the settlement is formed that things will go on more to my satisfaction and that the expenses will be greatly reduced. I beg my kind regards to all your family and to Mrs. Hughes and Mr. Hughes in which Mrs. M. joins. [67] If I can get anything to send by Mr. Hassall I will.
I remain
Dear Madam
Yours respectfully
SAMUEL MARSDEN.
P.S.-My little girls talk much about Mrs. Stokes. When they heard of the Box every ship excited their anxious wishes to see what was in it - At length it came to their joy.
