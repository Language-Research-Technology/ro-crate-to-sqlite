I began my return journey to Molonglo, staying the night at an inn. The next day I made a long journey, but camped out this time in company with four men attached to three or four bullock drays, going to Sydney. That was a mistake on my part, for here I was robbed of all my money. The men and I got on very amicably together; but as I lay sleeping in my blankets, one of them coolly took my trousers from under my head, emptied the pockets, and then returned the trousers to where he found them, which last act I saw him do. On pondering over the affair, and seeing that for once I had got into a den of thieves, and seeing the sort of men I had for companions, I came to the conclusion, to put up with the loss; I knew I should never see my money again. At breakfast, I told the man that he had robbed me, and that I saw him do it. He answered as I expected he would; he denied point blank that he had ever been near me, much more stolen anything from me.
I found my horse, which had been tethered out where food was plentiful, saddled him, and started on my journey, but penniless, and reached Berrima towards evening. [328]
Berrima had then a few houses and a new Court House and jail, and a very good inn, for Berrima was the centre of an important Police District, and at this inn I purposed staying the night. I intended to tell the innkeeper the fix I was in, and did not doubt, on promising to remit the cost of my providing as soon an I reached Molonglo, that I should get all my wants supplied. For, strange as it may seem to English readers, and even colonial ones of today, an innkeeper in those days seldom or never refused food and shelter to a belated traveller, even if no payment was promised. They knew well the risks that attended travelling in the interior, and never knew how soon they themselves might be in the same predicament. Let a man give his name, and the name of his employer, and that was enough. Every settler was well-known to the innkeepers for hundreds of miles. Arriving at the inn, who should I see standing at the door but a man I had known in Queanbeyan, Cooper by name, his real name. We recognised each other at once, I telling him the fix I was in. 'Never mind,' said Cooper, 'I will find you all that you require, both for yourself and horse, and money to go away with in the morning.' And Cooper did so. I had the best the inn could supply, and money to carry me on my journey. Before we parted in the morning, I said to Cooper: 'How am I to repay you what you have so freely lent to me? I am going to Port Phillip, and in all probability we shall never see each other again.' 'Don't talk,' said Cooper, 'about paying what I have given, not lent to you, you are an old friend of mine, and I like you, and am pleased to have the chance of helping you; I wish you well, and a pleasant journey'; and so we parted.
And yet Cooper, although still young, was transported for seven years to Botany Bay for night poaching, but was at this time free. When I knew him in Queanbeyan, I once said to him: 'Cooper, I wonder a man like you, fond as you were of poaching, in the old country, do not take your gun and range about the forest here, where game is plentiful, and there are no game laws to trouble you.' His answer was characteristic of a poacher. 'Oh, no! I care nothing about following game here. There are here no game laws I know, nor mantraps, and spring guns, which I was well acquainted with in the old country, and what is more, no gamekeepers. No! There is no devilment in it now.'
