4. Do you consider yourself the father of the Bar, here? Yes, I am the oldest practitioner in this colony of longer standing at the Bar than anyone in this colony.
5. Have you reason to think, Mr. Blake, that the appointment of a third Judge of the Supreme Court would be of advantage to the colony? I think it would be a decided advantage. Indeed, I think that, for the administration of justice, and the proper administration of the law, it is essential. I can give you my reasons.
6. Will you state your reasons, if you please, why you have come to that conclusion? Because, in the first place, there is no tribunal composed of two judges [as the Queensland Supreme Court then was], even if they were men of considerable ability and legal knowledge, that is not an imperfect tribunal. There is a great difficulty in two men, constantly sitting together, coming to an independent conclusion; they generally try, if they differ in opinion - they must constantly try - to accommodate matters between them, each giving up a portion. Whereas, if there are three, each forms a distinct and an independent opinion, and the majority decides: in fact, when I say three, it is an odd number. In England and Ireland, the feeling of the profession is opposed to two judges, though there are two in the Courts of Lords Justices of Appeal in Chancery; but they are not open to the same objection, because they are strictly Courts of Appeal; and there is a judge of the court below - there is the opinion of the judge below - so there are, in effect, three; if they differ, one must coincide with the judge of the court below. But I find that, even there, they are objected to. In the recent report of the Commission - published the other day to investigate the law system in England, I find that one of the recommendations is, that no court consisting of more than one judge should consist of less than three. That commission has the ablest men in England on it.
7. Are you not aware that the Chief Justice has the power of giving the casting vote? I am. I think that a very injudicious power - I believe that it is. I do not know of its ever having been exercised. I think the present Chief Justice is about the last man in the world to exercise it.
8. Then, truly, if they differ now, one has to accommodate himself to the other? That is the course. From my experience, that is what is done.
9. Can you give any other reason? I can give you a remarkable instance of that which occurred recently; in the case that was tried at Rockhampton, McGavin and Mac Master. In that case, the Chief Justice ruled upon a very nice legal question, wrongly, according to my opinion; and the verdict of the jury was clearly against the weight of evidence; and the matter was brought before the court for a new trial. Mr. Justice Lutwyche appeared to be of a different opinion from the Chief Justice; and, ultimately, they decided the case in the singular way, that they affirmed the ruling of the Chief Justice, but granted a new trial, because the verdict was against evidence; and they made the plaintiff pay the costs of the former trial, or directed him to pay the costs of the former trial; but the plaintiff, from his inability to pay those costs, has been unable to proceed any further. Now, if there had been three judges, the record of that case would have been entirely different, in my opinion.
10. Do you think the public is inconvenienced, seriously, by delays consequent upon there not being a third judge? I do. I think the unsatisfactory way in which the law business is done must be very prejudicial to the country - - must be very injurious; in fact, I know people suffer a great deal from it. [208]
11. Do you find, at times, that cases in which you are interested are seriously retarded, for want of your being able to obtain the attention of a judge? I cannot say they are retarded, in consequence of there not being a third judge. I think that they would be much more satisfactorily determined if there were a third judge. I think they are more retarded from the way in which the business of the court is managed.
12. Will you explain, further what you mean by the business being retarded? - In consequence of the way in which the rules are managed? Well, the principal objection is this: the business of the year is compressed into small periods, and then there are large intervals when, in fact, there is nothing doing.
13. Those intervals are called vacations? No: there are only, strictly, two vacations in the year. I have got the paper of the court before me, which I shall call your attention to: - the Christmas vacation commenced on Saturday, the 19th of December, 1868, and ended on Saturday, 13th February, 1869. Winter vacation commenced on Saturday, 5th June; ended on Saturday, 10th July, 1869. These are the vacations, strictly so called. I think the winter vacations unnecessarily and needlessly long. I do not think the summer is, for it is essential to everybody: it is not so long as in England - it is two months, summer vacation. It is essential for the people in this country, to enable them to get a rest, after the year's work; - a shorter vacation than that would not allow the members of the profession to take some recreation, which they all do. At that hot season of the year, I do not think that is too long. The winter vacation is. But it will be necessary to look over - 
14. May I ask you one question, before you go further? - Do you think it is absolutely necessary that there should be vacations? Oh! yes; I think so. I think there should be a summer vacation of not less than six weeks. During that time, of course, one judge would - as they do in New South Wales, as everywhere - attend to whatever business might arise. Of course, if there were three judges, the other two - as in New South Wales, or as in England, all but one - can go anywhere they please. One judge always remains at home - they take it alternately - to transact whatever business may arise during that time.
15. You were continuing your statement when I interrupted you? I was saying that the business is compressed into too short periods of time to allow it to be got through. There are four sittings in Brisbane for the trial of causes, in the year, for each of which the judges allow only a week, and, the week before term; so that there is no opportunity given to extend the sittings, if necessary.
16. And, if the business is not done during that week, what is the result? Such as what has taken place, recently, on three or four occasions; - that the business has to be postponed and heard at such intervals of time as can be obtained from other business.
17. Do those postponements add to the expenses of the litigants? Enormously. The principal expense is witnesses - retaining witnesses, who have, on many occasions, to be kept during all this time, and other expenses; of course, every expense is increased by it, but the great expense is in witnesses.
