if I had my liberty I would not go home for three or four years so I request of you to prepare yourself and come out as soon as you can for I can make as much money in three or four years as would support me without working whilst I live [...] I am in a factuary making soap and candles since I came to the Country and as happy as I please. I don't expect that my son John will be let with you so send him in the prison man ship [...] fail not to come for you will be as happy as you were in all your life [...] Dont forget bringing Peggy out [...] Tell my brother John to come if he can.
