To Colonel Peter Egerton Warburton., Leader of the South Australian Exploring Expedition.
SIR, - We the Council and Burgesses of the city of Perth congratulate you on the successful termination of your enterprise. The brave spirit which animated Captain Roe, the Gregorys, and Austin, on our side of the continent, equally impelled Oxley, Sturt, Mitchell, Leichhardt, Stuart, and yourself on its eastern side. The results to civilization have been vast, and, purchased with much suffering, have placed your names in the front rank of benefactors to mankind. Last on the list, it must be cheering to you to know that, under Divine Providence having accomplished the difficult and hazardous undertaking entrusted to you, you have thus prepared the way for future explorers still further to disclose to us the characteristics and resources of our island continent. We feel pride in being the first representatives of an Australian city to express to you their thanks and admiration of the energy, skill, and prudence you have displayed in the cause of exploration. [306] We would also record our gratitude to God, Who has preserved the lives of yourself and brave companions through all the perils of the way, and thus enabled us to give you our hearty greeting to-day.
On behalf of the Council and Burgesses of Perth,
G. RANDELL,
Chairman of Perth Municipality.
