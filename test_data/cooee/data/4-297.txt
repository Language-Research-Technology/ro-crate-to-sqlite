I am getting on extremely well, that is I am making a living which means in its turn that I have always enough tough damper and salt mutton to eat. I am still on the extreme head of the Preston River and about 50 miles from Wright's. I have been out over some of the back country looking for land. We rode day after day over a barren wilderness of sand and iron-stone gravel and saw (what would delight your eyes) herds of wild horses as we neared the better land on the other side of the said wilderness. We saw kangaroos in one place like flocks of sheep and emus too. Should the price of kangaroos skin rise I could make about £500 in about 12 months out there. The place has been seldom explored by whites. A few shepherds etc. are about the only ones. This country is covered by a plant or rather shrub which has a very pretty flower of a passionate red colour but it is a deadly poison to all stock. Sheep must be shepherded and kept out of the poison except horses (which don't chew the cud and of course kangaroos etc) so that you see settlement has been afraid to venture out. But the present responsible Government have recently made some very lenient acts relating to the purchase of this Poison Land as it is called. In fact they all but give it away only charging a £1 per 1,000 acres per annum for 21 years, when if you have the poison cleared off it and have it stocked and fenced you get a grant or the land becomes yours for ever and ever amen'. I thought on reading up the Poison Act that as the terms were so lenient I would go out and see the country and I went and liked it very well. I could take up 3,000 or 4,000 acres and in a few years if I picked (as you may bet I would) a place where the plant grew thin I could have a fine living and place. But before taking up any of it I am about to start out again to see more about it.
At present I am splitting a few thousand slabs and a few hundred posts and rails for a settler on the river here. I can tell you 9 feet rails (mahogany) take belting out with a heaw, maul or beetle and a dozen or so steel wedges. I am as strong as a wild bull and my heart is stout so I don't care a curse and never get down on my luck. Somehow I feel as if I must come out right. I have done so well all along. I have got a grand name for being a good worker. When I was navvying the navvies used to call me Jimmy the pony I was such a little stickler.
