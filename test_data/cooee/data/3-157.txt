MR. DENIEHY, amidst the most vociferous cheering, rose and said :- 
If anything could teach him how perfectly politic it was, irrespective of considerations of honesty and truth, for a man to walk in the straight path of duty, it was the reception that assemblage of the citizens of Melbourne had honoured him with. In politics, as in all other things, honesty was the best policy, and even an honest opponent men could afford to respect and admire, though they were not likely to treat him to such an ovation as he, Mr. Deniehy, had just received. He wished to do a plain and practical thing that evening, and having accepted their invitation to meet them, carry out his intention of giving a brief account of how opinion and action on the Land question stood in New South Wales. He would assure them that there was a desire as ardent and as deep in that colony for the settlement of this problem as there was in Victoria. The struggle they were making, the battle they were fighting, was no mere contest for theories, but a holy war to establish a final and equitable settlement of a question which, once wisely disposed of, would ensure the solution of all others. And if, as he, Mr. Deniehy, believed, the first great aim of statesmanship in a new country should be to people the soil - in a word, to create a great community, it was not saying too much to assert that an enlightened and progressive Land policy involved everything. [69]
Now he had heard, and with deep pleasure, of what had been said and done in Victoria on this great question, and the opinions expressed at the interviews of the Land Convention with Mr. Plunkett were pleasant and heartening tidings to the land reformers of New South Wales. He had been but a fortnight in Melbourne, but of one thing he was profoundly convinced - that here this essentially democratic question, the battle for a Land Law, which meant a battle for the existence of Australia as a great union of free and flourishing states, would be fought, and he, Mr. Deniehy, had faith enough in the right to believe it would be won. It was quite possible that here, as in the sister colony, the men who propounded a land policy similar to that of America, were looked upon as visionaries, as dangerous theorists, with a strong spice in them of, the Jacobin - men who were exasperated, and perhaps very naturally so, by the state of things, - the bitter, grinding competition and the absence of breathing room in the older countries; were mad upon the possession of freehold properties. [70] Perhaps authority and possession of the public estates, which possession was in Australian political practice as in law - nine points - imagined that the diseased ideality of the masses pointed to cottagé ornées and model farms on savage plains fit only for sheep and cattle and the nomadic servants of the pastoralist. But by way of answer to this, without going into the political economics of the matter, he, Mr. Deniehy, had one important fact to communicate to them, and it was one of the principal reasons why he had come there that night. It was that the adoption of the American Land System, as far, at all events, as regarded the central point around which all its peculiarities revolved, had been proclaimed by two Ministers of the Crown in New South Wales, two Ministers for Lands and Works, as being the only sound, reliable, and expedient national Land policy. The first Secretary for Lands and Works in Mr. Cowper's Government was his, Mr. Deniehy's, distinguished friend, Mr. Terence Aubrey Murray, Member for the Southern Boroughs. In this gentleman they had, perhaps, the only representative of the old territorial aristocracy who had come out from those with whom he had been connected by long years of sympathy and association to join the ranks of the Land reformers. Mr. Murray saw, when Mr. S. A. Donaldson thought fit to assume the premiership, under circumstances which he, Mr. Deniehy, and those who worked with him, held to be of a most un constitutional character, an attempt on the part of the Tory Squattocratic party to wrest the prize of responsible government for the purpose of perpetuating their own dominancy. That gentleman then became one of the most fearless, active, and determined leaders of the Opposition. In Mr. Murray they had one of the most highly cultured, the purest, the most eminent of men in character, in social position, and property in New South Wales, and though. he, Mr. Deniehy, had had sufficient experience in his life to know that the possession of vast wealth was no guarantee on the part of the lucky possessor, particularly on the Land question, he thought Mr. Murray's great stake in the country might be fairly taken into account in considering the value of the part he had taken and the views he had enunciated on the matter, for he, Mr. Deniehy, had repeatedly been told that nobody entertained selection notions but hare-brained Utopians, Jacobins at torchlight meetings, who not only knew nothing of the physical properties of the soil, but who never would have life, energy, or industry enough to know what the possession of landed property was, and who were certainly little disposed to recognise the sanctity of vested rights. Well, what was Mr. Murray's action in the matter? Not only did he hold, as the Land Convention of Victoria did, that the Land question was the only problem of national polity worthy at this stage of national existence of occupying a statesman's chief attention, - not only did he believe in free selection as they did, but he went even further. The Minister for Lands and Works, the highest type of an Australian gentleman, whom even his worst enemies recognized as a standard authority in practical rural affairs, went the length of moving in the House resolutions to the effect that if the Surveyor-General's Department (which by the way was one of the most exquisitely Machiavellian pieces of machinery for the complete strangling of colonial settlement which a Metternich in a moment of supreme inspiration might have conceived) could not, or would not, survey fast enough, it should be competent for an individual to go in on the land on his own survey, and take his chance afterwards, if he had not acted honestly, of having his lot reduced when the late and lengthy hour of the Government surveyor arrived. Fully and thoroughly in his views on free selection did Mr. Murray know and feel the common sense of the principle that every man, in the choice of a piece of land whereon he intends to found a home, is the best judge of his own requirements. He knew that Free Trade as applied to the settlement of a country was as true as to any other imaginable thing. Mr. Murray knew that a Government composed of all the sages the world ever saw, and backed up by the scientific knowledge of all the surveyors living, could not point out to a community of men the spots on the earth's surface that would individually suit them best. No ; Mr. Murray knew that the true politics of the Land question were the scattering of human souls, men, women, and children, and all the bounties, the charities, the graces of life, over the land. [71] [72]
The Australian Governments hitherto had unfortunately dealt with this question, not as a means towards an end, not as the instrument by which a great nation was to spring into being on their shores, but as the stock-in-trade of gigantic land jobbers and real property auctioneers, who, in the fervour for fancy prices, had lost sight of their duty and their trust. A high minimum price, and restrictions as to where a man should buy, were, no doubt, capital things in a saleroom; but if they wanted to see how they operated in the creation of states, let them look at New South Wales and learn. Ay, to-morrow, if that Colony, with her almost boundless territories, had a liberal Land Law, she might with high hopes of winning run a race with proud Victoria, all her golden treasures notwithstanding. 
The other Minister of the Crown to whom he alluded was his, Mr. Deniehy's, dear and honoured friend, Mr. John Robertson. In that gentleman, who was at present Minister for Lands and Works, not only did there meet all that was sound and sagacious in a politician, and brave, true, and generous in a man, but the topmost degree of rural experience, - the experience of a tiller and a dweller on the soil, - one, in fact, who had gone out with his flocks and herds, when squatting, for youth, energy, and small means was a living reality, and not an outlet for the greedy monopoly of the grasping capitalist. 
Mr. Robertson's ideas on the Land question were pretty well known to most of them. He it was who moved the insertion in the Cowper Land Bill providing for free selection, with such guards and restrictions as would protect the provision from the land shark and wholly reserve its benefits for the bona fide selector. Besides a practical knowledge of the country and the people such as few could boast but the present Minister, for twenty years a propagandist and confessor for freedom in the gloomy days when was rampant an oligarchy sprung from the darkness and degradation of the colony's penal origin, - besides those things, the hon. gentleman was an immense landed proprietor. [73] Was this then, the sort of man likely to be ignorant enough or designing enough to introduce an insidious evil into the policy of the land, where lay his all, unless he were convinced there was both right and expediency in the principles which he fought for? If the great land- owners ever did, and he, Mr. Deniehy, thought they seldom did, look upon this question as a matter privately affecting themselves, they knew that the settlement of the country must improve the value of their own possessions; and the huge, all-devouring squatter had, doubtless, as much sagacity on this point as they had. But the interest and the point of view were different. The squatter was oftenest a mere bird of passage, making use of land not his own, but the public's, on grossly unfair but gloriously profitable terms, till he had served his turn and filled his money bags. The squatter had but a passing interest in the soil, the people had their all; and whilst he, Mr. Deniehy, was on this subject, he would most emphatically warn the people to accept not of the intervention of "Liberals" - the so-called "Liberals," - in legislating for the settlement of the land. Those "Liberals" were in his, Mr. Deniehy's, opinion the respectable mild soda water of Australian politics - neither wine nor spirit. As this was a problem involving colossal private interests and sending ramifications through varying sections of society, they should have none but advanced men, men who went the entire zoology of the thing the great principle of free selection. Let them remember in this matter above all others, that those who were not with them were against them. 
Now briefly as to the nature of the clauses introduced by Mr. Robertson, and which he, Mr. Deniehy, had the honour and pleasure he never had greater in his life - of seconding. They would all recollect that the main feature in the Cowper Land Bill was the reduction of the general minimum price of £1 an acre, or rather the reduction of the class of lands used for pastoral purposes to 5s. an acre. On the wisdom and soundness of this proceeding all right-minded and disinterested thinkers in New South Wales were agreed. The present, as a general price, was prohibitory, and well did those who enjoyed the exclusive privilege know it; and besides, whatever the land was worth to the people of the day, it would, in most cases, fetch. Of old, in New South Wales, when the premier object was to settle the country, land was given away, ay, and convict labour to boot with it. In Canada much the same thing was still done; and in America the figure was at most but a quarter of our upset price. He, Mr. Denicehy, did not say that the land should be given away; all that he asked for was the fixing of a fair price, and the granting of facilities at and under which the people could obtain the land which suited them best. But he did say, and fearlessly say, that that Government knew nothing of its business who would not, if there were no other inducements for attracting emigration to their shores, give land away rather than be without population, and leave the territory a vast sheep walk, instead of a land of happy, smiling homes, strong, honest men, and fair and loving women. [74]
The chief features of Mr. Robertson's claims were deferred payments and permission to select wherever the applicant listed, on condition of actual residence and the cultivation of a certain quantity of the land. The details of the clauses were mainly of a character to protect the settler from the claws of the land-jobber and the trickster who fatten upon ignorance and credulity. The debate on Mr. Robertson's amendments settled the question of the admission or non-admission of free selection principles in the Cowper Ministers' Bill. His, Mr.Deniehy's, hon. friends in the Government were not prepared for anything so revolutionary, and in their minds intended to bring chaos back again. They seemed to coquette just a little-the least bit in the world-with squatting opposition, for they must remember squatting opposition was singularly seductive, and human nature - Ministerial human nature at all events - was not more shielded from temptation than others. Ministers refused to insert what would alone have made the Bill a reality and satisfied the country. Mr. Robertson thereupon moved the consideration of the Bill six months later. The squatting section, who believe in the status quo principle, of course joined the eleven good men and true. Ministers were driven to the country, and the Assembly dissolved. He, Mr. Deniehy, besought them to think and believe that any Land Bill which did not make free selection its cardinal point, its Alpha and Omega, was only a sham and a cheat. What was the greatest squatting interest of the hour, to which he, Mr. Deniehy, was no foe, but simply one who would not let it monopolise all, - what was it in itself but the grandest, the most signal, the most victorious proof of the soundness of the free selection principles as to the development of any interest connected with the opening up and making available distant lands ? What were the particular circumstances under which what was termed the land beyond the boundaries had been taken up ? How had the splendid energy of exploration thrown open for productive purposes the vast acreage of the country ? Simply by the practice of holding that the squatter was the best judge of where he should go, by placing no impediment in his way, but rather inviting him to go out, find, and occupy where he interfered with nobody. Had the men who pushed civilization on from line to line, who dared with dauntless courage and adventurous energy the boomerang and the poisoned spear of unknown savages, loss of life and the destruction of their property by barbarians, - had they been kept idle and seen their money waste, not only till it pleased the Surveyor-General of his public grace to mark them out stations, but the good pleasure of the Executive to say where they should turn in search of fresh fields and pastures new, - would river and plain after river and plain be as they were now, fair and prosperous with flocks and herds ? And what but this applied to another form of dealing with the soil has sent life and industry, religion and human love, from New York to Nebraska. and Oregon, and is carrying, by its quick, free, genial operation, the Great American races from the shores of the Atlantic to those of the Pacific ? [75]
Now he, Mr. Deniehy, had heard that it had been denied that there was any recognition of that kind of theory in American law. With all modesty and the most unfeigned respect for the opinions of those who denied the thing, and, unless some dementing spell was laid upon men who got into the chaotic hurly-burly of land politics, he, Mr. Deniehy, had himself seen and quoted in the Parliament of New South Wales a statute in answer to a denial on the subject by the honourable member for West Camden, Mr. James MacArthur. And he, Mr. Deniehy, had reprinted the clauses of that Statute in the Empire newspaper at the time the Land debate was occupying public attention. But granting even that free selection was not statute law in the Union, it was practice and usage recognised by the Federation, and therefore the common law of America. He, Mr. Deniehy, as a lawyer, thought it mattered little as to consequences whether a thing remained cognisable at common law or was triable by statute. [76]
They, the men of Victoria, in their new, thoroughly democratic country, had, a glorious task before them in this struggle. Every blow they struck here would be a blow struck for their brethren beyond the waters of the Murray; and he, Mr. Deniehy, had faith at all times in the Victoria people - a faith fresh kindled and ablaze since he had been amongst them, seen them, known them, learned to respect and find in them so much of the young, valiant, independent blood of Europe - that they would manfully help and assist his own countrymen. In doing this, they would not only benefit themselves, but open homes for those in the Old World who are fainting by the way for want of air and breathing room. It was a grand thing for them all, a thing worth living for, to have a hand at once in the building up of a nation, and the redemption of the sorrowing and the unfortunate from that pain which comes of seeing want in the eyes that are dearest in all the world, and which make earth heaven. This was their work. He, Mr. Deniehy, knew that they would do it, and do it nobly, and in a moral sense as well as a material "make the howling wilderness to blossom like the rose."
