The facts, which have been placed beyond a doubt by the analysis of the statistics of the two countries which is now brought to a conclusion, may be summarised thus: - 
1. That New South Wales having had 50 years the start of Victoria, four times the territory, payable coal fields, and all the other advantages enumerated in the first of these articles, with its so-called perfect fiscal policy thrown in, is to-day far behind Victoria, industrially and financially, measured either by rate of progress or actual results.
2. That while New South Wales shows larger results gauged by the bare figures in the matter of foreign trade, the figures are themselves not to be depended upon, and even if they be absolutely correct the trade they represent is very largely made up of dealings for commissions in the products of other countries rather than a legitimate trade in its own products.
3. That while our external trade is somewhat smaller than that of New South Wales it is of a healthier and more profitable character, and every year increasingly so as the finished products of our factories are increasingly taking the place of raw material in our exports.
4. That eliminating the one product, wool, from the exports of both countries as an article unaffected by either fiscal policy, our exports of all other products exceed those of New South Wales, and that the portion of them represented by manufactured goods is with us increasing, while with New South Wales it is decreasing.
5. That in the matter of intercolonial trade we have distanced our rival entirely, so much so that in the markets of New South Wales itself the greatest demand is found for our manufactured and other products.
6. That as regards the progress even of the pastoral industry, as gauged by the value of stock, Victoria has had far and away the best of the competition during the past decade.
7. That in the department of Agriculture New South Wales is so far behind as to make the idea even of a comparison absurd. [265]
8. That as regards the export of agricultural products our neighbour has not yet reached the stage of self dependence for its food. supply, while Victoria has for years past had a large surplus to sell abroad.
9. That as a manufacturing country New South Wales is hopelessly in the rear; that while it makes a hard struggle to keep in sight, even on paper, by claiming to have thousands more factories than Victoria has, it is of no avail; for the factories so called are chiefly repairing workshops, producing little or nothing, as the imports of New South Wales show that the class of goods they are supposed to make have to be almost entirely supplied from abroad.
10. That on the other hand our factories are what they claim to be; that they are constantly increasing in numbers, but more particularly in size and importance, as shown by the enormous growth in the value of their plant, machinery, land and buildings, and their output of finished products.
11. That whatever progress has been made by New South Wales during the past 20 years is largely due to two causes altogether apart from its fiscal policy; the one being the development of its pastoral industry by Victorian capital and energy, and the other being a reckless and lavish expenditure of money by the Government, chiefly obtained from the sale of Crown lands, the people's' patrimony.
12. That bringing the whole facts of both cases and the whole circumstances of both countries to the test of actual results, as proved by the accumulations of wealth in each, the outcome is so immensely in favor of Victoria and its protective policy as to make any further comment or discussion superfluous.
Judged by these practical results, therefore, direct and indirect, Victoria and the policy of protection come triumphantly through the ordeal, and New South Wales adds another to the many illustrations of the national folly of being guided by "theorists," and the danger of leaving the shaping of a country's career to those sections of its community who, having no ideas of their own, are content to follow such monitors.
