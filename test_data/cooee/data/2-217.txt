Dear Sir, 
The Rev. W Cowper has just made known to me that he has been privately informed by the Colonial Secretary, that it is the intention of the Colonial Government to remove the whole of the Civil Establishment from Wellington Valley. In consequence of which, dear sir, I beg leave strongly to recommend to the Home Society, that they should lose no time in forming a proper Missionary Establishment. If they expect anything of importance from the present one they must be disappointed. If you, dear sir, duly received my letter of December last year you will find that I requested permission to visit England (if the Society intended me to continue as Agriculturist to the Mission) for the purpose of obtaining a female Partner. This I wrote under the anticipation that the Mission would be removed from Wellington Valley. But as the Mission is now not to be removed from that place, I have no wish to return to England. That is - if the Society wish me to continue as Agriculturist to the Mission. If I continue to hold my present situation it is necessary - indispensably necessary - that I should be a married man. This is the opinion of the Home Society I know. Then if the Society should send out other Missionaries to this country, the female in question might come out with them very well, without my returning to England. That is if the Society will pay her Passage and give her the customary outfit. She has expressed her willingness to come under these circumstances. I shall write to the female in question, dear sir, and give her the necessary information requesting her to write to the Society on the receipt of my Letter. stating her wishes and determination. If the Society approve of my proposition I trust dear sir, you will write to the female in question, informing her of the fact, and kindly giving her any information, which may be desirable, relative to her embarkation. 
If the Society should remove me from Wellington Valley, the above mentioned requests will be unnecessary. 
I remain dear sir, 
Your humble Servant in Christ Jesus. 
William Porter.
P.S. Perhaps it may be desirable for me to give you the "address" of the person above mentioned, which is as follows; 
Miss Beeston 
Mr Abell's 
Halland Ward 
Derbyshire.
