I am going to turn farmer in the course of six months. The land is not very good not as regards the nature of the soil but it is very hilly. It was the best I could get except the scrubby country which would take a man with a big capital, a stout heart and plenty of muscle. The first and last commodities I am a bit deficient in. I believe when I get (I should say we for the boys are finding the cash but the land is applied for and recommended in my name) the fences up and the timber killed it will be a good grass country. The block contains 800 acres. One half is very good but the other is almost valueless. It will be under a government lease for 10 years or 14 years from the passing of the Act, which came into operation at the beginning of 1884. Out of the leasehold I can select 320 acres which will be excised from the leasehold and subject to a yearly payment of 1s. an acre per year for 20 years when it will be a freehold. [172] [173] The remainder of the land I will be paid for improvement up to the value of 10s. but not exceeding that amount, on the expiration of the lease. Then James has purchased four building allotments at £10 each. They will likely be worth a good bit some day for property about Melbourne is increasing in value very rapidly. 
I have turned gardner again; the tram driving did not suit my health. My health has much improved within the last month. I was troubled with my liver and kidneys. I got examined by a herb doctor and am now drinking herbs or the tea of herbs. I believe herbs are the best as they have no injurious effect whatever [...]
