David is helping the Hanna family to do some work at pruning and clearing orchard beside them which they had took a contract for. D has £1 and his wife has 10s. 0d. per week. 
[...] Sarah Susie and I went to Beechworth on last Friday to take her affidavit concerning a block of land that adjoins mine. It will save her from having to go to Bairnsdale. She has a good chance to get it. I have got notice to pay my first half year's rent and survey fees; will pay it next week as I have it ready. If nothing better turns up I will be able to give David work for a spell. I sent John some vine cuttings last week which will be useful to stock both places. I sent him a lot last year and they are doing well. His fruit trees is looking well now and expects a good crop from them. He intends planting two acres of potatoes along with his other vegetables which he is very proficient at. John intends keeping a few pigs to use up refuse vegetables milk etc. He sold half ton of melons and vegetable marrows. All he wants now is enough money to put on a good stock of either sheep or cattle and I suppose he would need a wife too.
