Mr. Justice Owen, N.S.W.
6th November, 1896.
Dear Sir, - 
I regret that my judicial duties will not enable me to accept your very courteous invitation to take part in the People's Federal Convention at Bathurst. The cause is one which has my warmest sympathy, and as it is apart from and above all party politics, I see no reason why a Judge should not assist in the movement.
I trust your efforts may be crowned with success, for it appears to me that Federation must come, and the longer it is delayed the greater the difficulties will be in carrying it out.
The troubled state of affairs in Europe and the Far East, and England's apparent isolation, seem to point to the necessity for Australia to present a united front to any dangers that may arise.
Yours faithfully, 
Wm. OWEN.
T. A. Machattie, Esq., President Bathurst Federation League.
