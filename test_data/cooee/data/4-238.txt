DEAR 'BDG',
This morning hot, windy & warm as I travel down the line & the mirage sizzling & jiggering over the railway track. I arrive at my cutting 'The fatal cutting' & inwardly rejoice at the prosperous warmth all glowing before me as I descend & reascend the opposite side up to my shading, shelving, sandstone rock, perched right up. I wipe the wholesome moisture from my pale brow - & having partaken of a pull at my billy (like a somewhat lengthy & affectionate kiss) I look up & down at my subject - is it worth painting? Why of course damn it all! - that is providing I'm capable of translating my impression to the canvas - all is serene as I work & peg away: retiring under the rock a bit when the light any shots - then 'Up with that Bl- F-g waggon Bill'. x - 
11.20. the 'Fish' struggles over the hill & round to Glenbrook.
12 O'CLOCK The next shift comes toddling down the hot track with their billies, & I commence to discuss my lunch & tea (of which I consume over a qt of every lunch) - & now I hear 'Fire! Fire's On!' in [illegible] the gang close by rest my billy on the rock take out my pipe & listen for the shots with my eye watching the bright red gum yonder - BOOM & then rumbling of rock, the navvy under the rock with me & watching says, Man killed - He runs down the sheltered side & cries 'man killed!'; another takes it up & now it has run through the camp. more shots & crashing rock we peep over & he lies all hidden bar his legs - & now men, nippers & 2 women hurry down a woman with a bottle & rags - all the shots are gone but one & all wait & dare not go near - then someone says the last hole was not lit - & they raise the rock & lift him on to the stretcher, fold his arms over his chest & slowly 6 of 'em carry him past me - Oh how full of dread is the grey mysterious expression of death - 'tis like a whirlpool for the eyes - Blown to death 20 yds from me - & as a navvy said 'twas 'Anorrible sight' - By jove - a passing corpse does chain your eyes & indeed all your senses just as strongly as love - all the men followed slowly up the hill & now all are gone but me & the fatal rocks & I dont feel up to my lunch - so have a smoke & peg away at my gem: but the poor chap, who I was speaking to only yesterday haunted me so that I put my gem away & came away too - & had a shower & smoke & read & thought of him all the while - I asked a navvy if the chap was married - 'No Sir. But one of the Shannon girls is a good bit cut up' - it seems he was engaged to be married - 
THURSDAY
The men didn't go back to work - this sort of thing skeers em a bit. go tomorrow all right I suppose.
GOOD NIGHT & / HOW ARE YOU GETTING ON / SMIKE
