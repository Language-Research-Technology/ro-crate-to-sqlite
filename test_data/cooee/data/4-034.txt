I will tell you the principal reason for being called a tyrant, because I will not allow any of the men to keep black women which on nearly all the other stations both masters and men do. I may be guilty of what you say, being too fond of bossing, but I do not think so, but I dare say I am but a partial judge and I should think you were even more so. I know at least in most things you are. I never did profess to be a gentleman. I have got rid of all the bad men I had and the ones I have now are all rather decent. 
[...] I do not want you to treat me with reverence only with love and that you always do: it is not in your nature to do otherwise. I quite agree with you that happiness is not at all dependent upon wealth. In fact I have rarely known very wealthy people what I would call happy. On the other hand I do not consider poverty conducive to happiness either. It may have the effect of drawing a family closer together but there are many things connected with it not calculated to give happiness. Should it ever become my lot to be possessed of wealth I do not think I should live in a grand style. I prefer quietness, I hope you do too but I do not think I am likely ever to be troubled with that, I have no ambition to be a so-called wealthy man. So long as I have you to love and cherish I shall consider myself rich in the true sense of the word. Yet for your sake I would like to have a fair competence. Did I not hope to have a house of my own sometime and you with me I should be content if I got enough each day to pull me through. That saving young man I wrote about and whose photo you wear in your locket never saved a penny scarcely in his life until within the last year and now he saves all he possibly can and then thinks he does not save near enough, and all that is through you so you see what an influence even a little woman can have on a person whom she loves and who loves her although separated by thousands of miles. 
I hate to receive anything and not to be able to return the compliment. I do not mind how much people are indebted to me but I cannot bear to be indebted to anyone if I can at all avoid it. It worries and annoys me. sometimes I even feel so about you and wish I could do something that would in some measure make up for all I owe you but I can only wait and hope to be able to do so by and by. Then my darling I shall do all I can to prove how much I value you.
