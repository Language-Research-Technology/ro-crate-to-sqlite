VORACIOUS SWINE FATAL ACCIDENT
Of all useful animals, swine are the most remarkable for voracity; and common observation may almost excite astonishment that from the very heedless mode in which they are at all hazards permitted to range in Sydney, equally serious accidents to that below do not frequently occur. To enumerate the ravages of swine so far as they extend to property alone would be unfeeling and contemptible when with an aching eye we contemplate so doleful an event which occurred on Monday last.
On that day an infant of Sarah Pearce, in the Brickfield's experienced a fate the most distressing that can possibly be imagined.
The mother on returning home with the little creature in her arms, placed it on the bed, in order that she might herself go in search of two other children, but unhappily after which she closed the door, and secured a young pig also within the house.
After a short interval she returned and supposing the child to be asleep, paid no immediate attention to it. Some moments after, to her utter astonishment and horror, she accidently approached the bed, and there witnessed a spectacle, the horrors of which are not to be conceived. The pig had by some means mounted the bed, and was then in the very act of devouring the child.
The mother's shrieks brought the neighbours to bear witness of the calamity, but alas! too late to render assistance to the babe; whose face was torn to pieces and devoured; the hands of the ill-fated innocent were also mangled and destroyed, owing it is probable, to its incompetent resistance.
The voracious animal was shot immediately that the accident was discovered; and was afterwards burnt by the order of the Coroner. [...] 
Shame on the indecent miscreant!
If detection alight upon his contemptuous crime he shall be shunned and pointed at.
