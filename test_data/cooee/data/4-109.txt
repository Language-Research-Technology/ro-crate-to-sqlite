 [...] I daresay if you do come out to Victoria you would be less troubled with cold in the chest etc. I think it would be advisable for you to give it a trial if you don't get things to your satisfaction in Belfast. You would be more at home, at any rate, than John and I were when we came. You know something about where you are going; we did not. 
One thing you would not have much trouble in bettering your wages here although you need not expect to start with as much as you will get when you are a little time here. There is a little advantage taken of the new chums that way. 
McVicker is getting along pretty well although he was hardly pleased at the first. However he has got a couple of rises of screw. Perhaps a few remarks would not be out of place in case you do decide on coming out. 
A few good suits of clothes, fashionable made are never out of place; white shirts, socks, good boots and things much the same as we brought; a common suit (old) for aboard ship and a soft hat (light colour). Hard hats and clothes generally are worn much the same here as at home (bring John and I a blackthorn stick each). 
Provisions for Voyage
Butter is useful especially if the ship's butter is bad (it is sometimes very good); a tin of biscuits, tea, coffee and milk gooseberry and currant jams to be kept till the warm weather when the home butter is done; butter should not reach the hot region but used at the early part of the voyage or it will run to oil. If you are fond of cheese a little one would be no harm (this article I would say please yourself). Note a panikin is a common pint tin such as used at table but a mug is better for the hot tea; have nothing to do with cups and saucers; they are too easily upset. Do not bring ham; you might find trouble in getting it cooked (at least I would not). A £1 or 30s. given to the steward and cook is well laid out, in little instalments. Don't give much at first but often and they will get to know you. I think the enclosed cabins are better than the open berths which is sometimes a rough ground. There are four people in an enclosed cabin. [150] Of course they are dearer than open berths. Choice of boats; Austral, Orient, Liguria, Iberia are the largest and best; the others are all much alike. The Austral will save nearly a week on some of the smaller boats. 
Don't stow away fruit in your box it will only rot. Leave your gloves behind you; they would spot on the voyage. A dozen nice neckties are safe four in hand shape or windsors according to taste; collars, stylish shape (John and I wear 16); pocket handkerchiefs, only if good and cheap. 
Do not burden too much with anything. Some people make a mistake in bringing too many things.
