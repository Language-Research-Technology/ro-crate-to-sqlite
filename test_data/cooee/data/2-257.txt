TUESDAY WAS the Anniversary of the introduction of gas lights into the southern hemisphere; and in congratulating the Australian Gas Light Company on the success of its operations for the past year, we cannot but impress upon them the necessity of enforcing stringent regulations for the supply of a good and equal light. From some fault of the system at present, we hear many complaints from various quarters of the uncertain and irregular light which they derive from the gas, and we ourselves are constantly subjected to the same annoyance. We suspect this must arise from some mismanagement of the works, which, if properly looked into, might be remedied. Should the Corporation Bill pass, it is most likely that the streets of Sydney will be lighted with gas, so that it is necessary that the Company should be prepared to extend its operations. We should also think it probable, that as we become more familiar with the management of gas, and the purposes to which it may be applied, such as cooking, and a variety of mechanical purposes, that the demand would considerably increase. We noticed an apparatus at Mr Gill's confectionery establishment, in which gas is introduced neatly and effectually for the heating of coffee, tea, &c.
