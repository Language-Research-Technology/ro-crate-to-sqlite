Melbourne Feby 2d 1854 
My Dear Brother, 
I have written to yo[u] about eight weeks since and sent a draf[t] for thirty pounds. For fear of a disappointment with the first I now send you the other part which you will understand is for the same sum the first was for if you received it. You were mistaken in regard to the thirty eight pound you were of opinion my wife sent some time ago. She sent the ten pounds and the other part was sent by a friend unknown to her or me untill your letter reached here. I would have sent more money but I am told and glad to hear it that you are doing well and not in want of any thing. The times here are more uncertain than home. A person with a family [m]ust keep a reserve for fear the times might change as they have often done. 
I have made all enquiry about John Dwyer but Could not hear anything of him untill lately. Instead of Coming here his vessel was put into Morton Bay. Both me and Mick English are endeavering to learn of some of them who Come from there where to direct a letter to him and are both willing to pay his passage to here as soon as we Know where to write to. [171] If you hear from My Brother James send me word. I might have an oppertunity of writing to him as there are a great many vessels from here to America. I have seen the two Terry Ryans one from Moon-Voan and Ter from Bun a rea. They are both Gone to the deggings. Ter of Moon Vane was with his Brother John in Vandiamens land. He has a big family and doing well. Margret Callaghan is married and doing well about forty miles from here. She told me she meant to send money to have her sisters come out. If they are-Coming out you might send a letter by them along with one by post and then I am sure to get either. 
Yours &c. Michl Hogan Direct to the Care of Mr. Maurice Feehan friend in hand Little Collins Street for me.
