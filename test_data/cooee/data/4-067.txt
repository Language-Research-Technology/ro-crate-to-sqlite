John was only one day there when he wrote but he was likely to like his billet pretty well. He has a little bedroom to himself and eats with the overseer of the station and his wife. He was helping to put up some fences as he must know how to tighten the wire before he can be a boundary-rider. He says that Queensland is much ruffer country than Victoria as much as Victoria is ruffer than home, some of the roads in the bush being very bad and no stones on them. He describes them as like the moss roads.
